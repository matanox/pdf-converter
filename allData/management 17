LUZI HAIL ∗ The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA In this study, I examine whether balance sheet and income statement numbers have lost or regained their relevance over the last 30 years. 
Institutional and macroeconomic factors like the global trend towards strengthening regulation and harmonising ﬁnancial reporting, the extended use of fair values over historical cost, and the recurring occurrence of accounting scandals, market bubbles, and ﬁnancial crises make it likely that the role of ﬁnancial reporting for ﬁrm valuation has changed. 
Following prior research, I estimate four models for the concurrent relation between market value and accounting numbers, and then examine the pattern in explanatory power over time. 
I ﬁnd that the loss in relevance of the income statement continues in recent years and is present in a large international sample, in particular in countries with strong institutions. 
While the overall relevance of the balance sheet remains stable, I ﬁnd a downward trend during the ﬁrst sample half, which reverses in the second half, especially in common law countries with strong investor protection, strict disclosure requirements, and integrated markets. 
Even though several caveats apply, the results suggest that changes in the economy, the institutional environment, and in how ﬁrms operate affect the relative importance of accounting information for the use in ﬁrm valuation by outside stakeholders.

It is used to evaluate individual projects, business segments, entire ﬁrms, and equity or debt securities. 
We can witness this vital function of the accounting system in various instances. 
Exchange-listed ﬁrms frequently and regularly release voluminous ﬁnancial statements containing hundreds of numbers, schedules, and other disclosures to support in valuation issues. 
Financial institutions and brokerage houses spend large amounts hiring and retaining highly qualiﬁed ﬁnancial analysts to assist in internal decision-making and customers’ portfolio choices.

Originating with Ball and Brown (1968), academics in accou nting and ﬁnance have extensively studied the relation between capital markets and ﬁnancial statements, creating a rich body of research on the value-relevance of accounting numbers, equity valuation and fundamental analysis, the processing of accounting information by market participants, etc. 
(for overviews see, e.g. 
Kothari 2001, Richardson et al. 2010). 
As an educator, every year on the ﬁrst day of my introductory accounting class I emphasise the role of accounting for valuation; at our school we offer many speciﬁc class sessions or elective courses on this topic; and there exists a series of textbooks with a valuation perspective in mind. 
However, the importance of accounting information for valuation purposes is not uncontested. 
Concerns about the relevance of ﬁnancial statements to investors, lenders, and other creditors are expressed, with different intensities, on a regular basis (Dopuch 1971, Levitt 1998, Francis and Schipper 1999). 
The primary concerns are with regard to the content of ﬁnancial statements (only a small subset of the relevant information makes its way into the accounting system, and if so, it is not adequately measured), the timeliness of ﬁnancial reporting (much of the information released via accounting system is already outdated once it comes out), and the inherent discretion in ﬁnancial statements (managers can ‘cook’ the numbers to pursue their own personal goals). 
More recently, concerns about changes in the institutional and macroeconomic environment have been added to this list. On the one hand, there are attempts to harmonise ﬁnancial reporting, like theadoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in many countries around the globe, which proponents argue should increase the transparency and comparability of ﬁnancial reporting (see, e.g. 
Hail et al. 2010a,b for an overview). 
This goes along with an increasing reliance on fair value measurements, which under ideal conditions incorporate the investor perspective directly into the ﬁnancial statements. 
On the other hand, fair values are also a source of criticism because they are often difﬁcult to obtain and might, on purpose or not, introduce volatility into the accounting system (Ball 2006). 
In addition, ﬁnancial reporting took a lot of blame during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, the series of corporate scandals shortly thereafter, or the global ﬁnancial crisis. 
Consequently, the role of accounting information for ﬁrm valuation is subject to an ongoing debate. 
1.2 Outline Against this backdrop, I discuss in this article whether the role of accounting information for ﬁrm valuation has fundamentally changed over the last 30 years. 
In Section 2, I begin with a description of the conceptual underpinnings that relate a ﬁrm’s value to the accounting numbers it releases. 
Based on a framework proposed by Beaver (1998), the connection between ﬁrm value and current accounting numbers ﬂows through future expected cash ﬂows via the dividend discount model as well as future expected accounting earnings via expected payout ratios and fundamental analysis. 
I then tie this framework into the large body of research that examines the contemporaneous association between reported accounting numbers and stock prices and returns. 
I conclude this section by highlighting two crucial assumptions underlying the relation between accounting numbers and ﬁrm value, namely that (i) capital markets are informationally efﬁcient, at least in a semi-strong form, and (ii) information is not evenly distributed among ﬁrms and investors. 
Next, in Section 3, I brieﬂy discuss three institutional and macroeconomic megatrends with the potential to affect the relation between accounting information and ﬁrm value: (i) the global trend towards harmonising ﬁnancial reporting, (ii) the extended use of fair values over historical cost, and (iii) the recurring occurrence of accounting scandals, market bubbles, and ﬁnancial crises. 
While the effect of the ﬁrst two developments could go either way, i.e. improve or loosen the contemporaneous relation between accounting numbers and market values, the third 330 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 element rather questions the general suitability of the traditional accounting system to cope with today’s economic reality. 
In Section 4, I take these arguments to the data and examine the long-term trends in the explanatory power of accounting numbers for measures of market value in a large international sample over the 1981–2008 period. 
More speciﬁcally, I show that the proportion explained by the income statement, either in a traditional levels and changes in earnings speciﬁcation or a Basu (1997)style reverse earnings relation, has continuously gone down and lost about a third of its explanatory power over the last 30 years. 
At the same time, the explanatory power of total assets and liabilities and of a combined earnings and book value of equity model has remained stable, on average, but exhibits large variation over the years. 
The balance sheet measures lost explanatory power in the ﬁrst half of the sample, but regained it in the second half. 
These results do not suggest a general loss of relevance of accounting numbers, but indicate an ongoing shift in focus from the income statement to the balance sheet. 
1 I then examine whether these trends in explanatory power vary by several institutional and macroeconomic factors. 
For instance, using the distinction between countries legal tradition as in Ball et al. (2000), I show that in common law countries earnings lose their explanatory power more rapidly compared to code law countries, so that by the end of the sample period the two sets of countries are not distinguishable anymore. 
The reverse holds for the balance sheet relation. 
Total assets and liabilities explain more of the variation in market values over time in common law countries, but I do not ﬁnd evidence of such an upward trend in code law countries. 
The results obtain after including country ﬁxed effects, effectively controlling for unobserved (time-invariant) heterogeneity in value relevance across countries. 
I ﬁnd similar trends for other institutional factors. 
Speciﬁcally, earnings become less relevant in countries with relatively strong disclosure requirements and more integrated markets, while the explanatory power of balance sheet numbers only increases in countries with integrated markets, strong disclosure requirements, and better legal protection of minority shareh olders. 
2 These results illustrate that the role of accounting numbers for valuation purposes varies substantially (and systematically) with countries’ institutional context (Ball et al. 2000, Leuz et al. 2003, Burgstahler et al. 2006). 
Before proceeding, a few caveats are in order. 
First, my tests examining trends in explanatory power over time show mere associations and do not speak to the underlying sources of the changes. 
Thus, while causality is elusive, the analyses indicate systematic variation over time, which could be due to changes in ﬁrms’ accounting practices, changes in the institutional and macroeconomic environment, or changes in underlying ﬁrm economics. 
This result by itself is important to better understand the relation between accounting numbers and ﬁrm value. 
Second, the tests allow no inferences about whether the explanatory power of accounting numbers is at a desirable level, or whether this number should be higher. 
All I do is examine changes in this metric over time, and compare different institutional regimes in a relative sense. 
Finally, I do not take side in the contentious debate about the relative dominance of the valuation role over other roles of the accounting system like stewardship or contracting. 
I would rather leave this discussion to others (Holthausen and Watts 2001, Kothari et al. 2010) and, in line with Lambert (2010), argue that valuation is among the several important rol es of a multi-attribute system such as accounting, and therefore deserves its due attention. 
2. Conceptual underpinnings 2.1 Framework for the use of accounting information in ﬁrm valuation To establish a conceptual relation between current ﬁrm value (measured as a ﬁrm’s stock price) and contemporaneous accounting information, we need to develop three separate but interrelated Accounting and Business Research 331 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 links (Beaver 1998, Chapter 4): (i) the link between current stock prices and future expected cash ﬂows, (ii) the link between future expected cash ﬂows and future earnings, and (iii) the link between future earnings and earnings as realised (and reported) today. 
In this framework, as depicted in stylised form in Figure 1, the primary role of accounting is to improve the third link, i.e. to help generating better estimates of future earnings via fundamental analysis. 
It should be noted that the interrelations between the three links are in no way static, but may change over time. 
For instance, improvements in market efﬁciency can put more weight on the ﬁrst link. 
Changes in the nature of the ﬁrms (e.g. the shift from a primarily manufacturing to a more service- and technology-oriented economy) can alter the role and usefulness of fundamental analysis. 
The ﬁrst link builds on the assumption that the current value of the ﬁrm reﬂects th e present value of all future cash inﬂows and outﬂow between the ﬁrm and its investors. 
If we knew these cash ﬂows with certainty, we could compute the market price of a security at any time by discounting the future payments with the risk-free rate. 
Under uncertainty, we replace the certain future cash ﬂows with their expected value and adjust the discount rate for risk. 
The role of information and hence, among other things, ﬁnancial reporting for this link is to alter investors’ beliefs about the input parameters of the dividend discount model. 
For instance, information about current earnings might alter the expectations with regard to a ﬁrm’s ability to pay dividends in the future and lead to an adjustment in stock prices. 
The second link stipulates a relation between future expected cash ﬂows and future expected accounting earnings, for instance, in the form of an expected payout ratio. 
Thus, accounting earnings must have some relation to dividend payments, which under the rules of accrual accounting and clean surplus by construction is the case, at least in the very long run. 
That is, the distinction between accrual-based and cash-based accounting is that accruals can predate or follow cash payments, but that the difference will reverse over the course of the underlying economic transaction’s time horizon. 
Because we can neither observe future cash ﬂows nor future earnings, the relation between the two measures comprising the second link is rather tenuous. 
3 Figure 1. Conceptual link between market measures and accounting measures. 
The ﬁgure illustrates how contemporaneous accounting numbers are conceptually linked to the value of the ﬁrm via future expected earnings, dividends, and cash ﬂows. 
332 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 The third link relates future accounting earnings to current accounting earnings. 
One can approach this relation from a rather methodological perspective and attempt to model the statistical time-series properties of earnings. 
Alternatively, we can take other sources of information into account like ﬁnancial analysts’ or management’s earnings forecasts. 
Even more broadly, we can decompose earnings (or other aggregate accounting numbers) into its fundamental components. 
For instance, operating income is the difference between sales revenues and the costs of goods sold. 
Revenues reﬂect future quantities and sales prices, which in turn vary depending on a ﬁrm’s product portfolio, marketing strategy, customer base, the competition in an industry, etc. 
The costs of goods sold are affected by economies of scale and scope, prices in the raw material markets, technological development, the regulation of labor markets, etc. 
This approach necessitates a fundamental analysis of accounting information, by means of which investors hope to come up with a better (i.e. less risky or more accurate) idea of future expected earnings with the purpose of identifying mispriced securities. 
Note that in such a fundamental analysis, ﬁnancial reporting is but one source of informat ion, albeit arguably an important one. 
2.2 Contemporaneous association between accounting information and ﬁrm value With these three links in mind, current accounting earnings and current ﬁrm values are conceptually related, and reported accounting numbers contain information relevant for equity valuation. 
This gives rise to the so-called association or value-relevance studies (see, e.g. 
Francis and Schipper 1999, Holthausen and Watts 2001, Kothari 2001), which test for a contemporaneous correlation between accounting numbers and measures of market value. 
Because investors have access to a multitude of sources aside from ﬁnancial disclosures that provide information in a more timely manner and in ways not feasible for the accounting system (i.e. subject to high uncertainty, relying on future instead of past transactions, and difﬁcult to measure), we cannot infer causality from such association studies. 
Rather, they tell us whether and how quickly information reﬂected in security prices ﬁnds its way into the accounting system (or vice versa). 
Put differently, a signiﬁcant association is indicative of some underlying common factor (presumably the economics of the ﬁrm via the three links outlined above) that ties accounting numbers to current ﬁrm values. 
Association studies take on different formats. 
In their most basic form they relate the market value of equity (as the dependent variable) to the book value of equity (as the independent variable) or some derivative (e.g. total assets and total liabilities). 
Alternatively, the change in market values is correlated to the change in book values or earnings. 
The underlying assumption here is that in an efﬁcient market security prices only move if new information is publicly released. 
Thus, in a change speciﬁcation, the level and year-to-year changes in earnings are often used to proxy for the unexpected component of ﬁrm-speciﬁc information contained in the ﬁnancial statements. 
To evaluate the value relevance of an accounting system, researchers consider the explanatory power (adjusted R 2 ) of accounting numbers for the measures of market value, and then identify a loss (gain) of relevance as decrease (increase) in explanatory power over time, or compare the explanatory power across different accounting regimes (Alford et al. 1993, Francis and Schipper 1999, Ali and Hwang 2000). 
In another way to get at the same issue, but based on the insight that accounting numbers systematically lag behind changes in economic income, Ball et al . 
(2000) estimate a Basu (1997)style regression that relates earnings (as the dependent variable) to returns (as the independent variable) and allow this relation to vary between positive and negative returns. 
They interpret the adjusted R 2 from this regression as a measure of timeliness that indicates how quickly accounting earnings incorporate changes in economic income. 
They then use the timeliness measure to evaluate accounting systems across legal systems, countries, and over time. 
Accounting and Business Research 333 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 All association studies have in common that they only allow relative statements, assume that market values are valid proxies for ﬁrms’ true economics, do not identify the exact means of how information from the accounting system affects investors’ common beliefs, are potentially subject to correlated omitted variables affecting both the price formation process as well as how information is represented in the accounting system (e.g. changes in the institutional environment or changes in the types of ﬁrms in the economy), and disregard the many other uses of accounting information not directly tied to equity valuation. 
2.3 Market efﬁciency and unequal information among ﬁrms and investors The valuation function of accounting implicitly assumes efﬁcient capital markets, at least in a semi-strong form. 
That is, stock prices should reﬂect the underlying true economic performance and value of the ﬁrm in a timely and unbiased manner, and incorporate all publicly available information as soon as it comes out. 
As such, stock prices can serve as proxy for economic income and represent an objective benchmark to evaluate the relevance of accounting systems in the time-series and the cross-section. 
At the same time, one of the purported goals of fundamental analysis is to identify mispriced securities, for which the current stock price is either too low or too high compared with the ﬁrm’s fundamentals. 
This idea led to the detection of accounting-based anomalies (Sloan 1996) suggesting that not all information provided by the accounting system is processed efﬁciently and immediately reﬂected in security prices. 
Moreover, the degree of mispricing seems to vary across countries and over time (Pincus et al. 2007, Green et al. 2011). 
The existence of such market mispricing can impede the interpretation of association studies (Ab oody et al. 2002, Fung et al . 
2010). 
The issue of market inefﬁciencies likely is particularly prevalen t in an international context spanning many different jurisdictions and with long multi-year observation windows, and matters most if the mispricing correlates with the dimension under study (e.g. across institutional features like the enforcement of insider trading laws or the extent of minority investor protection). 
A second important feature of the information environment affecting the use and interpretation of ﬁnancial reports is the unequal distribution of information between ﬁrms and investors and among investors (see, e.g. 
Verrecchia 2001 for an overview). 
Often we canno t simply take information as given (i.e. a new piece of information is released and all investors update their priors accordingly), but have to consider the underlying incentives of the managers releasing the information for proper interpretation. 
Because the incentives of those producing the information are not necessarily aligned with the users of the information, we might face an adverse selection problem (ex ante) and/or a moral hazard issue (ex post). 
For ins tance, when trying to raise external capital, management has incentives to overstate favourable news and to hide unfavourable news so that the proceeds from the offering are maximised. 
Once the securities are issued, management might be tempted to increase their share of the ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows (e.g. in the form of higher compensation or via ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial perks) at the expen se of the outside investors. 
In turn, investors will preempt these actions, and adjust their behaviour accordingly. 
For instance, they might price protect (i.e. demand a higher return for their risk) or require independent monitoring like the use of an external auditor to reduce the agency costs. 
As a result of such incentives problems between a ﬁrm and its investors’ prices and disclosures might not always reﬂect the underlying true economics. 
This misrepresentation, often referred to as earnings manipulation or earnings management, introduces bias into the accounting system thereby potentially hampering its usefulness for valuation. 
4 334 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 3. Institutional and macroeconomic trends In this section, I discuss institutional and macroeconomic megatrends with the potential to affect the relation between accounting information and ﬁrm value. 
The idea is to identify drivers of change that could lead to an increase or decrease of the value relevance of accounting information over time or give rise to differences in the cross-section. 
I discuss three factors: (i) the global trend towards strengthening regulation and harmonising ﬁnancial reporting, (ii) the extended use of fair values over historical cost, and (iii) the recurring occurrence of accounting scandals, market bubbles, and ﬁnancial crises. 
Unavoidably, this selection is incomplete and subjective, but all three topics have received much attention in recent years and are closely tied to the accounting system. 
5 Moreover, although discussed separately, the three factors are likely interrelated and reinforce or mitigate each other. 
3.1 Regulation, standard-setting, and harmonisation of ﬁnancial reporting Regulation is a widespread phenomenon around the world, has grown vastly over the years, and touches all aspects of our lives (see, e.g. 
Shleifer 2005). 
Arguments in favour of regulation refer, among other things, to the existence of externalities, economy-wide cost savings, commitment problems, and insufﬁcient penalties for individuals. 
At the same time, regulations can impose substantial costs. 
For instance, regulators may face serious information problems, are often incompetent or even corrupt, and can be captured by the regulatory process. 
In addition, regulations need adequate implementation and enforcement in order to be effective (Christensen et al. 2011). 
These features imply that the net beneﬁts of regulation s are not a priori obvious, that new regulations can create strong incentives for all parties involved, and that even though the same on paper the effect of regulations can vary substantially across entities or individuals depending on how they are implemented and enforced. 
The trend towards more and more comprehensive regulation extends to the accounting system. 
The goal of accounting standards is to provide a uniﬁed framework for the measurement and disclosure of business transactions relevant to investors, lenders, and other creditors. 
Thus, standard-setters face a tradeoff between expanding the set of rules to keep up with the changing business environment and protect the interests of investors (in light of the above-mentioned adverse selection and moral hazard issues) versus leaving managers with enough room to convey their superior knowledge to corporate outsiders while staying within extant rules and regulations. 
Probably the largest regulatory change in accounting history is the global move towards mandatory IFRS reporting (see, e.g. 
Ball 2006, Nobes 2006, Hail et al. 2010a,b, Pope and McLeay 2011). 
Since the mid-2000s more than 100 countries have either adopted IFRS or are in the process of doing so. Proponents of this change argue that harmonising and tightening accounting standards improve the transparency and comparability of ﬁnancial reports. 
More transparent disclosures and reporting rules, applied consistently across countries and industries, should facilitate benchmarking and the prediction of future earnings. 
Consequently, we would expect a general increase in the relevance of accounting numbers for valuation purposes that is most pronounced in countries with weaker accounting standards (relative to IFRS). 
In addition, cross-country differences in accounting should vanish over time. 
On the other hand, it is not obvious whether simply mandating new accounting standards is sufﬁcient to change ﬁrms’ reporting behaviour. 
In light of uniform ( and potentially indiscriminating) disclosures fundamental analysis could become even more difﬁcult. 
Moreover, accounting practices not only reﬂect rules and regulations, but also managers’ reporting incentives that are shaped by ﬁrm attributes (e.g. capital needs, ownership structure, and growth prospects) and a Accounting and Business Research 335 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 country’s institutional environment (e.g. its legal tradition, the protection of minority shareholder rights, etc.). 
Hence, IFRS need to be backed-up by adequate enforcement that ensures proper implementation and follow-up action by the regulator in case of incompliance. 
6 Under this view, IFRS might only have an impact on the valuation role of accounting if bundled with supporting enforcement changes or if appropriate enforcement mechanisms are already in place. 
That said, even though the verdict on the economic effects of IFRS is still out, many studies so far underscore the importance of the institutional environment and changes therein for the observed beneﬁts around the adoption of IFRS. 
3.2 Extended use of fair values over historical cost In synch with the trend of harmonisation, accounting standards themselves have become more reliant on fair values over historical cost when measuring assets and liabilities on a ﬁrm’s balance sheet (see, e.g. 
Barth 2006, Benston et al. 2006, Laux and Leuz 2009). 
If quoted prices in active markets are readily available, the measurement is straightforward and overall, the book value of equity should get closer to its market value and react more quickly to changes in price. 
However, for many assets and liabilities liquid markets do not exist or, if they do, markets might dry up when we need their guidance the most, namely during periods of crisis and ﬁnancial distress. 
Management then has to switch to historical cost accounting or, under certain conditions, can use the so-called mark-to-model approach, which requires assumptions about the underlying input parameters of the fair value estimates. 
This approach brings us back to the discretion inherent in the accounting system whose effect can be twofold: (i) improve the informativeness and value relevance of accounting numbers or (ii) incentivise managers to selﬁshly manipulate accounting numbers thereby introducing bias into the ﬁnancial statements. 
Another issue with fair value accounting is the asymmetric treatment of price changes. 
While the balance sheet always represents the estimate of an asset or a liability’s fair value at period end, the period-to-period change in value does not consistently ﬂow through net income (NI). 
For instance, depending on the classiﬁcation of securities as trading or available-for-sale, the unrealised gain or loss ends up either in the income statement or as part of other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. 
This asymmetry could lead to a reduced relevance of income statement numbers for valuation purposes, but strengthen the position of the balance sheet. 
Other problems frequently cited in conjunction with fair value accounting are unwanted shorttermism that could cause ﬁrms to realise gains before the intended maturity of a project, doubts about the efﬁciency of market prices, especially in times of low liquidity and crisis (which in the extreme could create a downward spiral), or intensiﬁed volatility of earnings due to the procyclical nature of fair values. 
However, the fact that the accounting system may act as focal point for management incentives is not unique to fair value accounting but applies to many instances; market efﬁciency is at the core of any association study; and procyclicality could actually increase the timeliness of accounting information instead of just exacerbate value swings. 
In addition (and as already pointed out in the introduction), the equity perspective is just one of the many facets of ﬁnancial reporting, and in a world in which frictions and contractual obligations tied to accounting numbers exist, contracting issues are likely to interfere with the equity valuation goal (Holthausen and Watts 2001). 
3.3 Accounting scandals, bubbles, and ﬁnancial crises Over the past 15 years, the use of accounting numbers has been marred by numerous scandals (Enron and Parmalat are just two prominent examples), and repeatedly the usefulness of 336 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 traditional generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) reporting for decision-making was questioned, in particular in industries with few economic transactions that pass the reliability and veriﬁability criteria typically required for recognition in the balance sheet (e.g. during the Internet ‘bubble’ in the late 1990s). 
In addition, we have experienced several ﬁnancial cri ses that have severely impacted companies’ ﬁnancial statements thereby casting doubt on the usefulness of accounting information for ﬁrm valuation. 
One thing these episodes have in common is that stock prices deviate from the true value of the ﬁrm, at least in hindsight, until investors’ beliefs catch up with the underlying fundamentals at the outbreak of the crisis, the burst of the bubble, or the uncovering of the extreme earnings manipulations. 
7 Put differently, we have observed, in different settings and over extended periods of time, a decoupling of fundamental information and quoted prices. 
This decoupling emerges from both sides. 
On the one hand, management m ight misstate earnings and balance sheet numbers to achieve short-term goals. 
For instance, Enron inﬂated its revenue by reporting gross instead of net sales ﬁgures, recorded long-term energy contracts using mark-to-market accounting (i.e. preempting future unrealised proﬁts at the time of sale), and had large portions of its debt hidden in special purpose enti ties that were exempt from consolidation. 
On the other hand, market prices can become independent of investors’ beliefs about ﬁrm and macroeconomic fundamentals. 
For instance, during the dot-com boom ﬁrms traded at commonly used valuation ratios like price-to-book or earnings-to-price far above the historic long-term averages. 
It was not unusual for startup ﬁrms to go public without having earned a single proﬁt or having sold a single product. 
The decoupling of market prices as quoted on the stock exchanges and fundamental values as depicted in the ﬁrms’ balance sheets and income statements could render the conceptual links between ﬁrm value and accounting information moot (Figure 1). Consequently, the value relevance of accounting information should diminish. 
8 In its place, other functions of the accounting system like stewardship, monitoring, or contracting could take on a more prominent role. 
4. Empirical analysis 4.1 Relevance lost or relevance regained over the la st 30 years? 
Against the backdrop of the conceptual underpinnings and the institutional and macroeconomic forces potentially affecting the relation between accounting information and ﬁrm value, I now take these arguments to the data. 
More speciﬁcally, I examine the long-term trends in the explanatory power of accounting numbers for measures of market value in a large international sample over the 1981 –2008 period. 
The idea is to provide descriptive evidence on whether aggregate balance sheet and income statement numbers (total assets and liabilities, book value of equity, and net income) explain more or less of the variation in market values and stock returns over time. 
In a second step, I examine whether the general time trends differ across institutional regimes (e.g. by a country’s code law or common law legal tradition) or the state of the economy (e.g. by the extent of a country’s integration into global capital and product markets). 
9 I then use these relative comparisons over time and across countries to measure a loss or increase in relevance of the accounting system as regulated by GAAP. 
My research follows in the footsteps of earlier studies. 
Most notably, Francis and Schipper (1999) study the changes in explanatory power for a sample of US ﬁrms through the mid1990s. 
They document a loss in relevance of the income state ment (in line with popular claims that accounting has become less useful), but also an increase in relevance of the balance sheet. 
My analysis extends their research to an international setting and a longer time period. 
For Accounting and Business Research 337 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 both dimensions, it is not a priori clear whether the US evidence applies. 
Basu (1997) ﬁnds that during periods of high legal liability exposure for auditors, ﬁrms recognise bad news on a more timely basis than during periods of low legal exposure. 
In a similar vein, Ball et al. (2000) show that the value relevance of earnings (losses) systematically varies across countries’ legal regime and decreases (increases) in the second half of their 1985–1995 sample period. 
Both studies illustrate how the accounting system does not function in a vacuum, but is closely tied to the institutional environment and shaped by country-level and ﬁrm-level incentives. 
This insight is important when assessing the value relevance of accounting numbers for a large global sample over a horizon of 30 years. 
10 I next brieﬂy describe the research design, explain how I measure changes in value relevance, and provide details on the sample selection and composition. 
I then present results from annual cross-sectional regressions for the entire sample and test for the existence of a simple linear trend in the data. 
Finally, I partition the sample into various subgroups and examine whether in each subgroup differential time trends in value relevance are present. 
4.2 Test design and sample description Following prior literature, I measure the relation between market values and accounting numbers using four models, two focusing on the income statement, one on the balance sheet, and one on the combination of the two elements. 
Speciﬁcally, I estimate the following regression speciﬁcations using ordinary least squares: Earnings relation: RET =b 0 +b 1 NI/P +b 2 DNI/P + 1, (1) Reverse earnings relation: NI/P =b 0 +b 1 RD +b 2 RET +b 3 RD ∗ RET + 1, (2) Balance sheet relation: P =b 0 +b 1 AST +b 2 LIAB + 1, (3) Book value and earnings relation: P =b 0 +b 1 BV +b 2 NI + 1. (4) I use the annual buy-and-hold stock return (RET) and the market value per share at ﬁscal year end (P) as the market measures. 
The accounting measures are NI and the yearly change therein (DNI), total assets (AST), total liabilities (LIAB), and the book value of equity (BV). 
To estimate the Basu (1997) reverse earnings relation, I also deﬁne a binary indicator RD set to one in years with negative stock returns and zero ot herwise. 
The raw values are computed on a per share basis and denominated in US$. 
I truncate all variables at the ﬁrst and 99th percentile. 
For further details on the measurement of the variables see the notes in Table 2. The intuition underlying these models is to relate (undeﬂated) balance sheet amounts to the market value of the ﬁrm or, in the spirit of a changes speciﬁcation, to correlate stock returns to the (deﬂated) levels and changes in earnings. 
11 In particular, Equation (1) represents the changes speciﬁcation of Equation (4) assuming clean surplus, and the two models should be interpreted in conjunction (Easton and Harris 1991). 
For the reverse earnings relation, we use returns as a proxy for changes in economic income and relate them to accounting income, each separately for ‘good news’ and ‘bad news’ events. 
I operationalise value relevance as the explanatory power of the above regressions (measured by the adjusted R 2 ), i.e. the percentage of the variation in stock returns and price explained by the accounting 338 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 variables (or vice versa). 
12 I interpret changes in explanatory power as gains or losses in the relevance of ﬁnancial statement information. 
To formally test for systematic changes over time, I estimate the following two regression models: Linear trend model: Adjusted R 2 =b 0 +b 1 TIME + 1, (5) Two-period model: Adjusted R 2 =b 0 +b 1 POST94 + 1. (6) I take the adjusted R 2 , the dependent variable, from annual cross-sectional regressions of either the entire sample (resulting in one observation per year) or of individual countries (resulting in one observation per country and year). 
The two trend variables are: (i) TIME set to one in the initial sample year and increasing by one for every year thereafter, and (ii) POST94 set equal to zero in the ﬁrst sample half and to one in the second half. 
These variables allow for a linear trend in value relevance over time, or alternatively break up the entire sample into two equal-length periods and compare the value relevance across subsets. 
13 In the cross-sectional tests I later interact the trend variables with variables for the respective partitions. 
The sample consists of all observations between 1981 and 2008 with sufﬁcient accounting data in Worldscope (WS) and stock price data (Datastream) to estimate the four valuation models. 
I require a minimum market value of 1 US$ million and only include countries with at least 500 observations (25 in any given year). 
This selection procedure results in a sample of 324,090 ﬁrm-years (807 country-years) from 40 countries. 
Table 1 provides a breakdown of the sample by country (Panel A) and year (Panel B) together with mean values for a select few market and accounting measures. 
While there are several large countries in the ﬁrm-year analysis (e.g. 
USA, Japan, and UK), the country-year panel is much more balanced and no single country assumes a dominant role. 
The average annual stock return over the sample period is 12.6% (not adjusted for market returns). 
However, this number varies largely by country and over time. 
Stock returns were negative in 46.1% of the ﬁrm-years, but the proportion is much higher in times of crisis (e.g. in 2008 or in the early 2000s) and considerably lower in the ﬁrst half of the sample. 
This pattern is consistent with a more frequent occurrence of crises in later years, and should be kept in mind when examining whether the accounting system has become more conservative over time (i.e. recognises economic losses faster). 
On average, NI (change in NI) before extraordinary items amounts to 2.9% (1.6%) of price. 
This number has been steadily decreasing over the years. 
The table also includes a country-by-country list of the institutional variables discussed later in the cross-sectional tests. 
Closer in spection of the sample reveals two important facets (not tabulated). 
First, while the mean market value of the sample ﬁrms increases from US$ 543 m to US$ 707 m over the course of the sample period, the size of the median sample ﬁrm drops from US$ 188 m to US$ 102 m. Thus, more and more smaller ﬁrms enter the sample over time. 
Second, along with ﬁrm size the industry composition of the sample changes as well. 
Speciﬁcally, the weight of traditional industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, or wholesale trade goes down (the proportion of ﬁrms with one-digit standard industrial classiﬁcations (SIC) codes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 decreases from 73% to 59%) while ﬁnancial institutions and service ﬁrms become more important (the proportion of ﬁrms with one-digit SIC codes 1, 6, 7, and 8 increases from 27% to 41%). 
The latter group includes many new technology and growth ﬁrms for which fundamental analysis might pose a challenge. 
These patterns raise the issue of how structural changes in the sample (in addition to or in conjunction with the macroeconomic and institutional trends discussed in Section 3) might affect the value relevance of accounting numbers. 
14 In Table 2, I report distributional characteristics (Panel A) and correlation coefﬁcients (Panel B) for the variables used in the valuation models.

I require ﬁrms to have a minimum market value of equity of 1 US$ million, and limit the sample to countries with at least 500 observations (25 in any given year). 
This results in 807 country-year observations. 
The table reports the total number of unique ﬁrms and the number of ﬁrm-years (country-years) by country (Panel A) and year (Panel B). It also includes the means of the following market and accounting measures: RET is the annual buy-and-hold stock return inclusive of dividends and computed over a ﬁrm’s ﬁscal year. 
RD is a binary indicator set to one if a ﬁrm’s return RET is negative and zero otherwise. 
NI/P is annual earnings per share scaled by the stock price at the beginning of the ﬁscal year. 
I compute earnings per share as total NI before extraordinary items (WS 01551) divided by the number of common shares outstanding (WS 05301).DNI/P is the year-to-year change in earnings per share (NI) scaled by the stock price at the beginning of the ﬁscal year. 
I truncate all market and accounting measures at the ﬁrst and 99th percentile. 
Panel A also lists several country-level institutional and macroeconomic variables used to partition the sample in the crosssectional analyses: (1) a country’s legal tradition (1 ¼ common law; 0 ¼ code law) based on La Porta et al. (1997) and Ball et al. (2000); (2) the US economy (¼ 1) versus the remaining countries (¼ 0); (3) the anti-self-dealing index from Djankov et al. (2008) with above-median sample values reﬂecting better legal protection of minority shareholders against insider expropriation (¼ 1); (4) the disclosure requirements index in securities offerings from La Porta et al. (2006) with above-median sample values reﬂecting better disclosure rules (¼ 1); (5) market integration measured by the KOF index of economic globalisation (Dreher et al. 2008) with higher values reﬂecting more cross-border ﬂows of goods, capital, and services and fewer trade restrictions; and (6) growth prospects equal to the mean market-to-book ratio for all ﬁrms in a country and year. 
The latter two variables are measured on a yearly basis (and hence continuous).

4.3 General trends in value relevance I start with estimating th e four valuation models in the pooled sample employing a single timeseries and cross-sectional regression, and report results in Panel A of Table 3. To mitigate concerns about dependence of the residuals, I assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients with robust standard errors clustered by country and year (t-statistics in parentheses). 
Throughout the panel, the coefﬁcient estimates are all signiﬁcant and in line with prior literature. 
The earnings model explains about 7% of the variation in returns. 
As expected, the explanatory power of the reverse earnings model is higher, 9.6%, and almost all of it stems from the quicker incorporation of ‘bad news’. 
The balance sheet model and, even more pronounced, the combined earnings and book value of equity model explain about 50% of the variation in market values.

BV equals a ﬁrm’s common equity per share (WS 03501). 
NI is the per-share amount of total NI before extraordinary items (WS 01551). 
NI/P is annual earnings per share scaled by the stock price at the beginning of the ﬁscal year.DNI/P is the year-to-year change in earnings per share (NI) scaled by the stock price at the beginning of the ﬁscal year. 
I compute all the per-share amounts by dividing the total values with the number of common shares outstanding (WS 05301). 
The raw values are translated into US$ using the respective exchange rate at the end of the ﬁscal year.

The table reports coefﬁcient estimates and adjusted R 2 values for the following four regression speciﬁcations reﬂecting the relation between market measures and accounting measures: (1) Earnings relation: RET =b 0 +b 1 NI/P +b 2 DNI/P + 1, (2) Reverse earnings relation: NI/P =b 0 +b 1 RD +b 2 RET +b 3 RD ∗ RET + 1, (3) Balance sheet relation: P =b 0 +b 1 AST +b 2 LIAB + 1, (4) Book value and earnings relation: P =b 0 +b 1 BV +b 2 NI + 1.

Accounting and Business Research 345 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 More to the point than these average numbers is an analysis of explanatory power over time. 
Thus, in Panel B of Table 3, I report the coefﬁcients and adjusted R 2 s for the four valuation models, estimated separately each year from 1981 to 2008. 
Using country-clustered standard errors, most but not all coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant (not tabulated). 
In Figure 2, I plot the adjusted R 2 s from the contemporaneous relations between market and accounting measures over time. 
Panel A contains the two earnings models and Panel B contains the balance sheet model and the combined earnings and book value of equity model. 
A few things are noteworthy: ﬁrst, the Figure 2. Contemporaneous relation between market and accounting measures over time. 
The ﬁgure plots the adjusted R 2 s from 28 annual cross-sectional regressions of the (reverse) earnings relation (Panel A), and the balance sheet relation and the book value and earnings relation (Panel B). The sample comprises all ﬁrmyear observations from 40 countries over the 1981–2008 period with accounting data and stock price data available to estimate the four models (Table 1). The four regression speciﬁcations reﬂecting the relation between market measures and accounting measures are: (1) Earnings relation: RET ¼b 0 +b 1 NI/P +b 2 DNI/P + 1, (2) Reverse earnings relation: NI/P ¼b 0 +b 1 RD +b 2 RET +b 3 RD ∗ RET + 1, (3) Balance sheet relation: P ¼b 0 +b 1 AST +b 2 LIAB + 1, (4) Book value and earnings relation: P ¼b 0 +b 1 BV +b 2 NI + 1. For variable details see Table 2. The ﬁgure also reports a linear trend line for each model (dashed). 
The linear trend is statistically signiﬁcant (at the 1% level) in Panel A, but not in Panel B. 346 L. Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 explanatory power of the reverse earnings model almost always exceeds the explanatory power of the traditional earnings model. 
Thus, the asymmetric recognition of ‘good news’ and ‘bad news’ and the delayed incorporation of news in earnings seem better suited to explain the usefulness of the accounting system. 
Yet, the differences between the two models are never too big, and the respective adjusted R 2 s are highly correlated. 
Second, there is a distinct negative trend in the explanatory power of the two earnings models. 
The proportion explained by the income statement has continuously gone down, and NI has lost about a third of its explanatory power over the last 30 years. 
Third, balance sheet numbers have always a substantially higher adjusted R 2 than the income statement, but are trumped by the combination of book values and earnings. 
Thus, both the ﬂow and the stock of accounting information are important for valuation. 
Finally, the time-series pattern of the balance sheet models is ambiguous. 
While the value relevance of the balance sheet seems to go down in the ﬁrst sample half, it reverses in the second half. 
Over the entire period, no distinct trend emerges. 
In Panel C of Table 3, I conﬁrm the results of Figure 2 using the 28 annual adjusted R 2 s from each valuation model to estimate the linear trend speciﬁcation in Equation (5). 
The TIME coefﬁcient is signiﬁcantly negative in both earnings models. 
As a separate analysis of the two subperiods reveals, the loss in relevance primarily occurred during the 1981–1994 period, but came to a stop in the later years. 
At the same time, we observe a loss in relevance of the balance sheet in the ﬁrst sample half, which reverses from 1995 to 2008. 
In sum, my ﬁndings do not suggest a general loss of relevance of accounting numbers, but indicate an ongoing shift in focus from the income statement to the balance sheet. 
16 However, the average results do not allow any insights into the potential drivers behind the change, and might merely conceal more reﬁned patterns correlated with the institutional and economic environment across countries. 
I will turn to these explana tions next. 
4.4 Differences in value relevance across institutional and macroeconomic factors To test for cross-sectional differences, I modify the valuation and time-series models and introduce a (binary or time-varying) partitioning variable, PART, which I interact with all the independent variables. 
This fully interacted speciﬁcation allows me to separately estimate the effects for each subset and assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences across groups. 
The resulting time-series trend models look like follows: Linear trend model: Adj. 
R 2 =b 0 +b 1 PART +b 2 TIME +b 3 PART∗TIME + 1, (5a) Two-period model: Adj. 
R 2 =b 0 +b 1 PART +b 2 POST94 +b 3 PART∗POST 94 + 1. (6a) To increase the power of the tests, I estimate the models with the adjusted R 2 s from countryyear regressions using all observations in a given country and year. 
I also include country ﬁxed effects, essentially controlling for all unobserved time-invariant factors that contribute to the value relevance in a country. 
17 I deﬁne PART using one of the following six country-level variables: (1) a country’s legal tradition, (2) the US economy (versus the remaining countries), 18 (3) an index of the protection of minority shareholder rights, (4) an index of disclosure requirements in securities offerings, (5) an index of market integration, and (6) aggregate growth prospects. 
I transform the ﬁrst four partitioning variables into binary indicators using the sample median as cutoff. 
The last two variables are measured on a yearly basis (and hence time-varying). 
See the notes in Table 1 for further details. 
The intuition behind the choice of partitioning variables is to select broad characterisations of the institutional and macroeconomic environment that Accounting and Business Research 347 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 might capture correlated factors of the time-series trends in the value relevance of the accounting system including, among other things, the three global developments discussed in Section 3. Because of this nature (and the structure of the tests) causal interpretations are not possible. 
I limit the cross-sectional analyses to two models: the earnings relation for the relevance of the income statement (Table 4) and the balance sheet model with total assets and liabilities (Table 5). 19 For completeness, I ﬁrst estimate pooled time-series and cross-sectional regressions of the valuation models fully interacted with PART (using ﬁrm-year observations), and report the results in Panel A of Tables 4 and 5. The results show that the overall relation between market values and accounting numbers is fairly stable and does not vary much across the different subsamples (i.e. just a few of the interaction terms are statistically signiﬁcant). 
Only aggregate growth seems to have an impact on the balance sheet and the earnings relation (Collins and Kothari 1989). 
I next analyse the pattern in explanatory power over time and how it differs across subsets. 
To illustrate the idea behind this comparison, I plot the adjusted R 2 s from 28 annual cross-sectional regressions separately for common law countries and code law countries in Figure 3. As Panel A shows, the negative trend in the relevance of NI is much more pronounced (and only signiﬁcant) in common law countries than in code law countries. 
By the end of the sample period, the two sets of countries are not distinguishable. 
The results for the balance sheet relation are mixed. 
While the explanatory power of total assets and liabilities remains ﬂat in common law countries, I observe a slight upward trend in code law countries (signiﬁcant at the 10% level). 
Again, by the end of the sample period, the two subsets are indistinguishable from each other. 
Overall, the graphical analysis suggests that institutional differences have become less important over time, in line with increased harmonisation efforts of accounting standards and an ongoing integration of product and ﬁnancial markets. 
The analysis of the country-year adjusted R 2 s in Panel B of Tables 4 and 5 provide the following insights: ﬁrst, the decline in the explanatory power of earnings is present in the entire sample and primarily occurred in the second sample half. 
20,21 The loss in relevance is more pronounced in markets characterised by strong instit utions, i.e. common law countries with strict disclosure requirements and integrated markets. 
Only where higher growth prospects are present, the negative trend is slightly abated. 
Second, w hile insigniﬁcant for the entire sample, there exists a distinct upward trend in the relevance of balance sheet data in common law countries with strong investor protection, stricter disclosure requirements, and integrated markets. 
The US economy is a notable exception with a decrease in the explanatory power of total assets and liabilities. 
22 No or a slightly negative trend is apparent in countries with generally weaker institutions. 
The results obtain after including country ﬁxed effects, effectively controlling for unobserved (time-invariant) heterogeneity in value relevance across countries. 
Finally, by the end of the sample period, the differences across groups have often vanished. 
In sum, the results illustrate that the role of accounting numbers for valuation purposes varies substantially (and systematically) with countries’ institutional context (Ball et al. 2000, Leuz et al. 2003, Burgstahler et al. 2006). 
The three institutional and macroeconomic trends discussed in Section 3 (i.e. 
IFRS adoption, fair value accounting, and accounting scandals or market bubbles) likely contribute to the observed cross-sectional and time-series variation in value relevance. 
However, other potential explanations exist. For instance, the shift from a mainly manufacturing to a service-oriented economy, the increasing reliance on information sources and intermediaries other than annual reports (e.g. ﬁnancial analysts, media, blogs, etc.), the emergence of new technologies to disseminate information quickly and cheaply outside of the accounting system, the ongoing integration of global product and capital markets, or a rising volatility of market values due to changes in the market 348 L.

As long as these potential explanations differ across countries (which they likely do) and are correlated with the institutional proxies I use (which they likely are), they will be reﬂected in the differential trends in value relevance I report. 
Figure 3. Relation between market and accounting measures conditional on countries’ legal tradition. 
The ﬁgure plots the adjusted R 2 s from 28 annual cross-sectional regressions of the earnings relation (Panel A) and the balance sheet relation (Panel B), each separately for countries with common versus code law legal tradition (La Porta et al. 1997, Ball et al. 2000). 
The sample comprises all ﬁrm-year observations from 40 countries over the 1981–2008 period with accounting data and stock price data (Table 1). The two regression speciﬁcations reﬂecting the relation between market measures and accounting measures are: (1) Earnings relation: RET ¼b 0 +b 1 NI/P +b 2 DNI/P + 1, (2) Balance sheet relation: P ¼b 0 +b 1 AST +b 2 LIAB + 1. For variable details see Table 2. The ﬁgure also reports a linear trend line for each model and subset (dashed). 
The linear trend is statistically signiﬁcant (at the 1% level) for common law countries in Panel A as well as for code law countries (at the 10% level) in Panel B, but insigniﬁcant in the other cases. 
Accounting and Business Research 353 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 5. Conclusion In this study, I discuss the role of ﬁnancial reporting for ﬁrm valuation and empirically examine whether balance sheet and income statement numbers have lost or regained their relevance over the last 30 years. 
To frame my discussion, I use the three conceptual links outlined in Beaver (1998) that tie market values to contemporaneous ﬁnancial statements via future expected cash ﬂows, dividend payouts, and accounting earnings. 
The accounting system emerges as a particularly important source of information when it comes to analysing the fundamentals of the ﬁrm. 
I then brieﬂy discuss the general structure of so-called association studies that test for a contemporaneous correlation between accounting numbers and measures of market value. 
The explanatory power of such a speciﬁcation serves as proxy for the relevance of ﬁnancial reporting. 
Increases in the adjusted R 2 s indicate a gain in relevance; decreases a loss in relevance . 
At the same time it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this approach. 
We assume the price formation process is efﬁcient, and market participants, even though they have different information, pursue similar goals. 
Both assumptions likely are not always valid. 
Moreover, association studies do not lend themselves to draw causal inferences and therefore should be interpreted cautiously. 
I next discuss three institutional and macroeconomic megatrends with the potential to affect the relation between accounting information and ﬁrm value, namely the global trend towards strengthening regulation and harmonising ﬁnancial reporting, the extended use of fair values over historical cost, and the recurring occurrence of accounting scandals, market bubbles, and ﬁnancial crises. 
The idea is to identify drivers of change that could lead to an increase or decrease in the value relevance of accounting information over time or give rise to differences in the crosssection. 
Even though the selection is necessarily subjective and incomplete, it illustrates that there exist plenty of reasons for why the role of ﬁnancial reporting likely has changed over the last three decades. 
Finally, I take the above arguments to the data. 
I estimate four different valuation models – two focusing on the income statement, one on the balance sheet, and one on the combination of the two elements – and then examine the pattern in explanatory power over time. 
The analysis provides two general insights: ﬁrst, the loss in relevance of the income statement, already documented in prior studies, continues over a more recent period and is not just limited to a select few countries but present in a large international sample. 
If anything, the decline in explanatory power is even more pronounced in countries with a strong institutional background. 
Thus, recent changes in the accounting standards, but also in the nature of the ﬁrms as well as the general economic environment like increased globalisation and market integration or the emergence of new technologies and alternative ways to disseminate information seem to have rendered reported earnings numbers less useful for valuation purposes. 
Second, with regard to the balance sheet I do not observe much of a change in the overall explanatory power. 
However, looking more closely, I ﬁnd that the trend points downwards during the ﬁrst sample half and in countries with relatively weaker institutions, and upwards in the second half and in common law countries with strong investor protection, strict disclosure requirements, and integrated markets. 
Thu s, while stable on average, substantial differences in the value relevance of the balance sheet remain. 
Overall, the results suggest that changes in the economy, the institutional environment, and in how ﬁrms operate affect the relative importance of accounting information for the use in ﬁrm valuation by outside stakeholders, and that the ongoing harmonisation of accounting standards was not able to completely mitigate the differences. 
However, more research with reﬁned methodologies is needed to get a clearer picture of the underlying causes of the observed trends and to help us better understand the complex relation between accounting information and ﬁrm value.

Hail Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 Acknowledgements This study was prepared for presentation at the 2012 ICAEW ‘Information for Better Markets’ Conference, held on 17–18 December in London, UK. I am grateful to an anonymous referee, Christian Leuz, Cathy Schrand, Laurence van Lent, and conference participants for helpful comments and suggestions. 
Notes 1. This ﬁnding is in line with Francis and Schipper (1999) for a sample of US ﬁrms over the years 1952– 1994. 
However, I am quick to add that I am agnostic about the underlying causes that contributed to the observed shift. 
That is, aside from the three institutional and macroeconomic megatrends discussed in Section 3, other factors like the way how ﬁrms operate and communicate with their investors, or changes in the industry-mix of publicly listed ﬁrms likely affect the relative importance of accounting information in ﬁrm valuation. 
The aim of my empirical tests is to examine whether (and not necessarily how and why) such changes – in a broad sense – took place. 
I then offer some potential explanations, but am not able (and do not intend) to establish clear-cut causal links. 
2. When separately analysing the US economy, I do not ﬁnd a distinguishable trend in the explanatory power of earnings, but a reduction (instead of an increase) in the relevance of balance sheet numbers. 
3. The residual income valuation model (Feltham and Ohlson 1995, Ohlson 1995) formalises the link between expected future earnings and dividends by assuming clean surplus accounting thereby directly tying current book values and future accounting earnings to the current value of the ﬁrm. 
4. See, e.g. 
Drymiotes and Hemmer (2013) or Ewert and Wagenhofer (2012) for analytical models illustrating the effects of incentive conﬂicts on the valuation function and value relevance of accounting numbers. 
5. Other likely candidates affecting the relation between accounting numbers and ﬁrm value are: (i) the shift to a more service-oriented economy and – closely related – changes in sample composition due to economic and/or data reasons, (ii) the rise of alternative sources (and intermediaries) of information aside from GAAP-regulated numbers in a ﬁrm’s annual report (Lundholm and Myers 2002), (iii) variations in the relative importance of the transitory and permanent components of earnings, or (iv) systematic changes in the volatility of market values over time (Francis and Schipper 1999). 
6. For instance, in the European Union (EU) the IAS regulation that prescribed mandatory IFRS reporting for listed ﬁrms required member states to take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with IFRS. 
Consequently, several EU countries strengthened the enforcement of ﬁnancial reporting in conjunction with the IFRS mandate or shortly thereafter. 
Yet, substantial heterogeneity in how IFRS are enforced remains (Christensen et al. 2013). 
7. Note that earnings management, the rise and duration of bubbles, or the extent of crises do not assume irrationality, but can be explained by rationally behaving individuals. 
For instance, in the case of earnings management we refer to the existence of private information and misaligned incentives (Watts and Zimmerman 1986, Schipper 1989), for bubbles we often rely on heterogeneous beliefs among investors and the need for a coordination mechanism like a signal of when the bubble is going to burst (Abreu and Brunnermeier 2003), and for crises investors’ funding constraints can induce co-movement of prices with the market instead of with ﬁrm fundamentals (Brunnermeier and Pedersen 2009). 
8. In line with these arguments, Lev and Zarowin (1999) ﬁnd a reduction in the usefulness of reported earnings and book values, and attribute this effect largely to changes in the business environment (e.g. innovation, new technologies, etc.) At the same time, Core et al. (2003) ﬁnd only mixed evidence of such a reduction in value relevance during the dot-com boom. 
9. Due to the limitations of association studies I cannot (and do not attempt to) directly assess the marginal effect of the three trends outlined in Section 3 (i.e. 
IFRS adoption, fair value accounting, and accounting scandals or market bubbles). 
I use general characterisations of countries’ institutional environment and time-varying macroeconomic indicators on their behalf. 
This should allow me to uncover systematic differences over time and in the cross-section, but also indicates that the interpretation has to be taken with a grain of salt. 
10. Other papers that examine time-series changes in value relevance (mostly for US data) and relate those changes to various ﬁrm-speciﬁc or industry-wide and country-wide factors include Collins et al. (1997), Brown et al. (1999), Lev and Zarowin (1999), Core et al. (2003). 
Alford et al. (1993) and Ali and Hwang (2000) document international differences in value relevance. 
Rajgopal and Venkatachalam (2011) show a negative correlation between earnings quality and (idiosyncratic) return risk over the 1962–2001 period. 
Accounting and Business Research 355 Downloaded by [Open University Library - ISRAEL] at 11:26 28 October 2013 11. To make my results comparable to the vast value relevance literature I estimate Equations (3) and (4) using per share amounts. 
Hence, the models are potentially vulnerable to scale effects (Brown et al. 1999, Gu 2007), in particular if the number of shares outstanding varies systematically across countries and/or over time. 
When I repeat the analyses using (undeﬂated) total amounts or scale Equations (3) and (4) by either the book value of equity per share, total assets per share, or the standard deviation of daily stock returns over the ﬁscal year, these concerns are partially conﬁrmed. 
Albeit often insigniﬁcant, the general time trend in adjusted R 2 s of the balance sheet relation can vary depending on the deﬂator chosen (e.g. positive with returns variation, negative with total assets). 
Thus, the tabulated results have to be interpreted conditional on the per share scalar used in the analysis. 
12. Strictly speaking, Basu (1997) did not consider his speciﬁcation a reverse regression but rather was trying to model how conservative accounting leads to the asymmetric incorporation of news into earnings. 
In that sense, the adjusted R 2 is a measure of the timeliness of the accounting system and not necessarily comparable to the traditional value relevance metrics. 
Empirically, though, it turns out that the adjusted R 2 s of Equations (1) and (2) are highly correlated. 
13. The linear and two-period speciﬁcations implicitly assume that the institutional and macroeconomic factors affect the relevance of the accounting system in similar manner within each subsample (i.e. there exists a common trend); else we would not expect signiﬁcant results. 
14. To gauge the issue of sample composition, I separately re-run the main analyses for (i) ﬁrms in traditional industries versus ﬁrms in ﬁnancial and service industries, (ii) older versus younger ﬁrms (i.e. ﬁrms with longer or shorter time-series of data than half of what is possible per country in my sample), and (iii) larger versus smaller ﬁrms (i.e. ﬁrms with market values of equity above or below the country-year median). 
The general tenor of the Table 3 results is present in all of the above subsamples, but more pronounced (and in most cases statistically signiﬁcant) among technology and growth ﬁrms, younger ﬁrms, and smaller ﬁrms. 
These ﬁrms also exhibit lower levels of explanatory power and more asymmetric timeliness of economic losses. 
The results suggest that changes in the sample composition (for economic and/or data reasons) contribute to the documented ﬁndings and seem to reinforce the general macroeconomic and institutional trends that are at play. 
15. The comparisons of adjusted R 2 s across models are rather illustrative, as we cannot really compare this metric when the dependent variables differ. 
Moreover, scale effects also might impede the interpretation of adjusted R 2 s across samples and over time (Brown et al. 1999, Gu 2007). 
16. These results are in line with Collins et al. (1997) and Francis and Schipper (1999). 
17. As a consequence of including country ﬁxed effects, the main effect of the partitioning variables (b 1 ) drops from the model when PART is a binary indicator variable, and we only can estimate the two trend coefﬁcients (b 2 andb 3 ). 18. I separately analyse the US economy for ease of comparison with prior research and because forces that are present in the US might not necessarily translate to other countries with a different institutional and economic background. 
19. When I repeat the analyses with the reverse earnings relation and the combined earnings and book value of equity relation, the results are very similar to those tabulated and none of the inferences change. 
20. I assess the statistical signiﬁcance in the country-year analyses using t-statistics that account for within country cross-sectional and temporal dependence (Driscoll and Kraay 1998). 
21. The ﬁnding of a more pronounced decline in the value relevance of earnings after 1994 somewhat differs from the results using only 28 yearly observations presented in Table 3, Panel C. This might be due to the unbalanced country composition of the ﬁrm-year sample. 
22. As one potential explanation, Fung et al. (2010) attribute the observed decline in value relevance in the USA to stock prices becoming a worse measure of ﬁrms’ fundamentals over time due to more prevalent noise trading.
