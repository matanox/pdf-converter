Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 
INTRODUCTION For many years, the mission statement has been the primary organizational communication tool used to describe the firm to its stakeholders. 
According to Peter Drucker, often called the “father of management,” a mission statement is the “foundation for priorities, Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 strategies, plans, and work assignments” (Drucker, 1974). 
According to Drucker, it is the mission statement that distinguishes one organization from another. 
The mission statement provides the firm’s “reason for being.” Drucker also emphasizes that a mission statement is essential to the formation of the company’s objectives and strategies. 
The Leader to Leader Institute, established by Peter Drucker, has much to say about an effective mission statement. 
Drucker stressed that the mission statement should communicate the core of the organization with a precise statement of purpose. 
He suggested that it should be about three sentences long and touch on four topics including who we are, what we do, what we stand for, and why we do it. This is a lot to cover in a short three sentence statement. 
Drucker also felt that the mission statement should address distinct stakeholder groups including owner/investors, customers, and employees/society. 
The authors have discovered that many large corporations do not include these important stakeholders in their current mission statements. 
Mission statements should include all of the central characteristics of the company including the firm’s purpose, unique qualities, values, critical stakeholders, and basic goals/objectives. 
Mission statements have been called by a number of various titles including creed statements, statements of philosophy, statements of belief, and statements of business purposes (David, 2005). 
Fred David stresses that these statements should reveal both what a firm wants to be as well as whom it wants to serve. 
Therefore, a good mission statement should specifically mention important stakeholders such as customers and employees. 
David also states that the firm’s “reason for being” should be clearly stated in a firm’s mission statement (David, 2009). 
He argues that a well written mission statement should provide important information such as the products and services offered by the firm and the primary target markets served. 
David believes that a mission statement “identifies the scope of the firm’s operations in product and market terms” (Pierce & David, 1989). 
Robbins and Coulter emphasize that firm goals must reflect the mission statement. 
(Robbins & Coulter, 2012). 
They further state that the mission is a broad statement of the organization’s purpose providing a guide to all members of the organization. 
Many other authors emphasize the importance of a well written mission statement. 
For example, Annie McKee feels that without a well defined and developed mission statement, the firm loses its focus (McKee, 2012). 
McKee believes the mission statement must describe what the company stands for, what it does, who it considers important. 
She also believes that missions aid managers in decision making and integrating short and long term goals and objectives. 
Jeffery Abrahams reviewed over 300 mission statements from the largest U.S. firms. 
He found that these pronouncements reflected the firm’s values and priorities as well as providing a statement of purpose (Abrahams, 1999). 
Samuel and S. Trevis Certo argue that the creation of a mission statement is a critical part of the strategic management process (S. & S.T. 
Certo, 2012). 
The strategic management process requires a thoughtfully written mission statement to provide some organizational direction for its managers. 
This belief is shared by Hitt, Black, and Porter (M.A. 
Hitt, J.S. 
Black & L.W. 
Porter, 2012). 
They feel that a mission statement must articulate Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 the primary purpose of the organization. 
Other authors discuss the possible components of this primary purpose which may include basic company philosophy, primary products or services, customers served, obligations to stockholders and employees, and concern for the environment. 
(C. Rarick and J. Vitton, 1995). 
Schermerhorn, et. al., believe that good mission statements state whom the firm will serve and what purpose they are serving in society (Schermerhorn, et.al.). 
Currently many firms are clearly stating in their mission statement their goals of positively affecting society and preserving the environment. 
Wheelen and Hunger stress that a well designed mission statement defines the firm’s “fundamental, unique purpose” that sets the firm apart from other similar companies (T. Wheelen and J. Hunger, 2010). 
Finally, Thompson, et.al., state that a mission statement must describe the firm’s “current business and purpose” (Thompson, et.al., 2012). 
These authors emphasize that an effective mission statement should accomplish a number of things including identifying the firm’s products or services, specify customer groups or markets served, and giving the company its own identity. 
They believe the latter goal of creating the firm’s unique identity is especially important. 
To accomplish all of these goals in a concise statement, the firm’s management must carefully construct the mission statement and update it when appropriate. 
The authors agree that a mission statement is a critically important communication that organizations must create and communicate to all stakeholders. 
This short declaration must identify important stakeholders as well as describe the firm’s identified goals and objectives. 
This paper reviews the last four studies completed by the authors and describes the latest review of 2012 mission statements of the 25 largest firms in the U.S. and nine other countries. 
Similarities and differences will be summarized at the end of this paper. 
In addition, trends in U.S. mission statements from 2001 to 2012 are also reviewed. 
PREVIOUS MISSION STATEMENT RESEARCH The authors began their mission statement research eleven years ago. 
Four of the authors’ mission statement articles have been published in the Academy of Managerial Communications Journal (King, 2001) and the Academy of Strategic Management Journal (King, Case & Premo, 2010), (King, Case & Premo, 2011) and (King, Case & Premo, 2012). 
These studies have expanded in size in an effort to compare and contrast U.S. mission statements with those of foreign countries. 
A brief review of each study is presented in the following paragraphs. 
The authors’ 2001 study involved the Fortune 100 firms in the United States for that year. 
Table 1 summarizes the results of that study. 
The 100 largest U.S. company mission statements were reviewed for content with emphasis in two areas. 
First, the identified stakeholders were summarized including employees, customers, and stockholders. 
Second, the goals/objectives of the firm that were identified in the mission statements were summarized. 
Providing a quality Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 product or service that provided value to customers was a typical example of these goals. 
Table 1 is a summary of the 2001 mission statements. 
Table 1: 2001 FORTUNE 100 - MISSION STATEMENTS THAT INCLUDED Stakeholders Percent Goal/Objective Percent Customers 61 Quality 25 Stockholders 34 Core Values 25 Employees 21 Leadership 17 Competitors 9 Global 15 Suppliers 6 Technology 14 Governments 2 Environmental 9 Communities 6 Profits 6 Ethics 3 The left column of Table 1 is a summary of the identified stakeholders. 
As one might expect, the most often mention stakeholders were customers and stockholders (61% and 34% respectively). 
The third most often mentioned stakeholder group was employees (21%). 
The right side of the table is a listing of the most common goals or objectives of the firm. 
The goal of producing a quality product or service and following established core values were most common. 
Striving for a leadership position in the industry (17%) and the desire to conduct global operations (15%) were the next most listed goals of the organization. 
Notice that the goal of maintaining ethical operations was absent from the list. This may be, at least partly, the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act not becoming law until 2002. 
The authors’ next mission statement project was in 2008 when the Fortune top 50 U.S. corporations were studied. 
Table 2 shows the total number of organizations that included the listed stakeholders and goals/objectives in their mission statement in 2008. 
Table 2: 2008 FORTUNE TOP 50 - MISSION STATEMENTS THAT INCLUDED Stakeholders Percent Goal/Objective Percent Customers 31 Quality 26 Employees 17 Global 17 Communities 15 Ethics 15 Stockholders 14 Environmental 8 Core Values 7 Leadership 7 Suppliers 5 Profits 6 Government/Laws 2 Technology 1 In 2008, the most commonly identified stakeholders were customers and employees. 
On the goals/objectives side, the most frequently recognized items were the desire to produce a quality product and the attempt to conduct global operations. 
Following closely behind was the goal of conducting ethical operations that was reported by 15 of the top 50 firms. 
In order to better review the results of these two studies, Table 3 (below) converts the information from raw numbers (used in Tables 1 & 2) to percentages for easier comparisons. 
These percentages show that the use of the term “communities” increased five-fold from 2001 to Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 2008. 
Firms were beginning to recognize the importance of the communities in which they operated. 
Customers continued to be the most commonly included stakeholder (61%/62%). 
The large corporations continued to emphasize the marketing concept where the satisfaction of customer needs and wants is a prerequisite to successful operations. 
An increased emphasis on employees is also apparent increasing from 21% to 34%. 
These organizations obviously realized the importance of their human resources. 
Table 3 also shows a number of changes affecting the stated goals and objectives of the firms. 
The number of firms stressing the importance of ethics and the maintenance of ethical behavior increased ten times during this period (3% to 30%). 
This may be partly the result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. 
The percentage of firms emphasizing the significance of producing a quality product increased from 25% to 52%. 
The reported goal of conducting global operations also increased significantly from 15% to 34%.

The 2010 study included a comparison with the largest corporations in Australia, Canada, and Great Britain (King, D.L., Case C.J. & Premo, K.M., (2010). 
The authors compared the mission statements of these four English speaking countries in an effort to discover similarities and differences. 
The 2011 study summarized the 2011 missions of the biggest 25 firms in the United States with those of the largest firms in France, Germany, Japan, and China (King, D.L., Case C.J. & Premo, K.M., (2011). 
This paper summarizes the latest study by the authors of 2012 mission statements. 
The last column in Table 4 summarizes the results from a review of the most current mission statements.

Customers, not surprisingly, are mentioned in the mission statements far more than any other stakeholder (over 60% in each year). 
Community is still a commonly included stakeholder; however, it has dropped from its 2010 level of 40% to 28% in 2011 and 2012. 
Employees are mentioned less often in recent years dropping from a high of 34% in 2008 to 16% in 2011 and 2012. 
Stockholders/shareholders are also included less frequently slipping from the high of 34% in 2001 to 20% in 2012. 
Competitors and government were not mentioned in the 2012 missions. 
Suppliers were mentioned in 12% of the 2012 missions compared to only 6% in 2001. 
A review of the goals and objectives mentioned in these statements shows that the most commonly included are the desire to produce a quality product or service that represents a good value to customers, a concern for ethics and ethical operations, an emphasis on global operations, and the desire to be an industry leader. 
The importance of providing a quality product to customers reflects the firms’ attempt to follow the “marketing concept” which basically states that organizations must satisfy customer needs and wants in order to survive. 
This need to provide a quality product; however, has decreased from a high of 56% in 2010 to the current 32% in 2012. 
Ethical behavior has been emphasized in recent years remaining at 28% of firms over the last three years. 
The firms’ desire to be a leader in the industry took a big jump in 2012 increasing to 32% of firms from 20% in 2010 and 2011. 
The emphasis on profits and profitability has remained constant at 16% from 2010 through 2012. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 A TEN COUNTRY MISSION STATEMENT COMPARISON The final portion of this paper summarizes the authors’ most recent mission statement analysis of the largest 25 firms in the United States and nine other countries. 
The other countries studied included Canada, United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, Australia, Japan, China, Brazil, and India. 
These 250 mission statements were reviewed and analyzed as to the identified stakeholders and goals/objectives of the company. 
Due to the length of these mission statements, they are not included in an appendix. 
They are; however, available upon request from the lead author. 
It is the authors’ hope that this paper will provide an insight into the current mission statement status on a global basis. 
Significant similarities and differences can be uncovered by reviewing the summary results presented below.

Table 5 includes a mission statement summary for the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and China. 
Table 6 lists the summary results from Canada, United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Brazil, and India. 
A few of the 250 companies did not have an English version of their homepage and were not included in this analysis. 
These tables list the major identified stakeholders including community, customers, employees, stockholders and suppliers. 
Secondly, the tables summarize the most commonly Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 identified goals or objectives of the firm. 
These goals included supporting core values, concern for the environment, desire for ethical operations, need to operate on a global basis, striving for growth and expansion, and attempting to produce a quality product that provides value to customers.

These tables show that customers are mentioned far more often in mission statements than communities, employees, stockholders, and suppliers. 
The country most often recognizing customers in missions was Australia with 76%. 
Following closely behind are the U.S. and France with 68% of missions including customers. 
The country with the fewest number of large firms including customers in their mission statements is Canada with only 40%. 
In recent years, large firms have been increasingly likely to add concern for the communities in which they operate to their missions. 
Community was included in 52% of Australian missions followed by 32% in Brazil, and 28% in India and the U.S. 
Employees were included in 52% of Australian missions, 48% of Canadian statements, and 44% of the large firms in Brazil. 
Stockholders are another important stakeholder found in 52% of Australian missions, 44% of Brazilian statements, and 40% of the largest firms in China. 
Suppliers were the least frequently mentioned stakeholder found in only 24% of Australian, and 12% of the U.S., U.K., and Brazilian missions. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Table 7 shows the top three stakeholders for each of these ten countries in order of their frequency. 
The most frequently mentioned stakeholder was customers in nine of the countries. 
The only exception was Canada where employees (48%) were mentioned more often than customers (40%). 
The importance of the community is evident in the U.S. and India with 28% of their mission statements including this important stakeholder. 
Depending on the country, employees and stockholders represented the second and third most often mentioned stakeholder.

Tables 5 and 6 also summarize the goals and objectives included in the mission statements in these ten countries. 
The authors identified a total of 14 goals and objectives included in the mission statements from these ten countries. 
These goals ranged from providing a quality product that provided value to their customers to making sure that the products sold were safe for all potential customers. 
The most frequently mentioned goals varied from country to country. 
The following paragraphs discuss the most identified goals or objectives in these ten countries. 
U.S. firms stressed the importance of providing of a quality product or service that provides value to their customers and being a leader in the industry (both 32%), the maintenance of ethical business practices (28%), and conducting global operations (24%). 
In addition, U.S. missions also listed an emphasis on profits or profitability (16%). 
A recent addition to the list of goals for U.S. firms is affordability. 
This appeared in 12% of mission statements. 
French firms emphasized the company’s core values in 36% of their mission statements. 
This is far more than any other country (Canada was a distant 2 nd with 20%). 
Other commonly described goals in French missions included the desire to grow and expand (24%) and producing a quality product and stressing innovation (both at 20%). 
A recent addition to the list of goals was the need for teamwork. 
This was found in 20% of French missions which was far more than other countries (2 nd were Australia and India at 12% each). 
German mission statements emphasized the goals of providing a quality product or service (40%), being an innovator (32%), and stressing global operations (28%). 
Maintaining a leadership position in the industry (20%) and producing a safe product that was environmentally friendly were also common in these missions (16% each). 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Japanese firms stressed the goal of conducting global or worldwide operations (28%). 
The goals of maintaining innovation (24%) and the desire for growth and expansion (16%) were also common. 
The goal of operating in an environmentally friendly fashion was also found in 16% of these missions. 
Overall, Japanese missions statements listed fewer goals than the other nine countries. 
Many of the authors’ identified goals were only included in a few of the large Japanese firms’ mission statements. 
China’s mission statements emphasized the goals of providing a quality product or service (44%), conducting global operations (36%), and the desire for growth and expansion of the firm (32%). 
Also, 24% of Chinese missions included the desire to be an innovator in their industry. 
Finally, large firms in China include a goal that is unique to their mission statements. 
20% of Chinese mission statements included the desire for harmony in the firm or society and with the environment. 
This goal was virtually nonexistent in the missions of the other nine countries. 
Canadian missions stressed the objectives of being a leader in the industry (44%), maintaining ethical operations (40%), and the desire for global operations (28%). 
Producing a quality product (24%) was also a common goal for Canadian firms. 
Canada’s mission statements emphasized ethics and ethical operations to a larger percentage (40%) than any of the other nine countries. 
Other countries emphasizing ethics included India (36%) and Brazil (32%). 
The U.S. trailed these countries with only 28% of its missions including the goal of ethical operations. 
This is a bit surprising following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. 
The United Kingdom mission statements most often cited the goals of maintaining global operations (44%), being a leader in the industry (36%), and the desire to be an innovator (32%). 
Other goals listed included the emphasis on ethics and ethical operations (28%) and the need to grow and expand (20%). 
Australian missions emphasized more goals per statement than the other nine countries. 
The most commonly reported goals were concern for the environment and earth friendly operations and the need to produce a safe product and conduct safe operations (both 28%). 
The production of a quality product was found in 24% of these statements. 
Finally, 20% of these mission statements included the goals of ethical operations, need for growth and expansion, being an innovator, and maintaining a leadership position in the industry. 
Mission statements in Brazil stressed ethical operations and concern for the environment (both at 32%). 
Other common Brazilian goals included maintaining a leadership position and producing a quality product (both at 28%). 
The goal of maintaining growth and expansion was found in 24% of these statements. 
Indian statements stressed the desire for global operations and being a leader in the industry (both at 44%). 
Maintaining ethical operations (36%) and operating in an environmentally sound manner (24%) were also commonly included in these statements. 
Teamwork was also mentioned in 12% of India’s missions. 
France, Australia, and India were the three countries that most often mentioned the importance of teamwork. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 A summary of the most commonly mentioned goal or objective is found in Table 8. The goals are listed based on frequency with the most commonly mentioned goal listed first. There are a number of ties in the list and are so marked. 
The authors summarized the three most commonly identified goals for each country in the following list. Table 8: Most Commonly Identified Goal or Objective by Country Country Goal/Objective U.S. 1.Leadership/quality product (tie), 2.ethical practices, 3.global operations France 1.Core Values, 2.growth-expansion, 3.innovation/quality/teamwork (tie) Germany 1.Quality product, 2. innovation, 3.global operations Japan 1.Global operations, 2.innovation, 3.growth-expansion/environmental (tie) China 1.

Environmental/ethical (tie), 2. global/leadership/quality (tie), 3. growth India 1. Leadership/global operations (tie), 2. ethical practices, 3. environmental There is a good deal of variation in the goals of the firms by country. 
For example, producing a quality product that provides value to customer was a top goal in the U.S., Germany, and China. 
Following the core values of the firm was most commonly mentioned only in French statements. 
Concern for the environment was the most commonly identified goal in both Australia and Brazil. 
Leadership was most mentioned in the missions of Canada and India. 
The importance of ethics and ethical practices was included in the list above for the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, and India. 
The goal of conducting global operations was most typically listed in the missions of Japan, U.K., and India. 
The authors noticed in the 2012 study that teamwork is found in a reasonable number of mission statements. 
France (20%), Australia (12%), India (12%), U.S. (8%), Canada (8%), and the U.K. (8%) each had a number of firms that considered the importance of teamwork. 
MISSION STATEMENT EXAMPLES The next portion of this paper is devoted to listing at least one mission statement from each of these countries. 
Since this paper is based on a review of 250 mission statements, it is not practical to list all of them. 
The following are mission statements from each of the ten countries that provide a good example of a firm that attempts to identify both stakeholders and goals of the firm in the mission statement. 
From the United States, the mission statement of Kroger is an excellent example of a fairly comprehensive statement. 
Notice the desire for leadership and the list of stakeholders that the firm considers important. 
Kroger’s mission is: "OUR MISSION is to be a leader in the distribution and merchandising of food, health, personal care, and related consumable products and services. 
By achieving Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 this objective, we will satisfy our responsibilities to shareowners, associates, customers, suppliers, and the communities we serve." The authors selected the Renault Company from France. 
This mission is strong in the area of ethical behavior and concern for the environment. 
Renault’s mission is: “Developing Renault's core values means respecting employees worldwide and helping them to progress, fostering a spirit of openness, ensuring the full transparency of information and being honest and fair in accordance with the Renault Code of Good Conduct. 
It entails working with its partner Nissan in compliance with the Alliance Charter. 
It also means that today's results must be achieved in a way that lays the foundations for future success, while preserving environmental quality and the cohesion of the society in which Renault operates. 
In this way, Renault will be making its contribution to sustainable development around the world.” The German mission statement selected is from Daimler. 
This is a great example of a mission that lists both stakeholders and also the firm’s goals. 
Daimler’s mission is: “Our philosophy is clear: We give our best for our customers, who expect the best, and we live out a culture of excellence based on shared values. 
The history of our company is marked by innovations: These are the basis and stimulus for our claim to leadership in automotive production. 
It is our goal to successfully meet the challenges of future mobility. 
We intend to thereby create lasting value for our shareholders, customers, and employees, as well as for society as a whole.” From Japan, the authors selected Toyota Motors. 
Notice the goals of safety, quality, innovation, and concern for the environment. 
Toyota’s mission is: “Toyota will lead the way to the future of mobility, enriching lives around the world with the safest and most responsible ways of moving people. 
Through our commitment to quality, constant innovation and respect for the planet, we aim to exceed expectations and be rewarded with a smile. 
We will meet challenging goals by engaging the talent and passion of people, who believe there is always a better way.” Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 A good example from Chinese mission statements is the China Merchants Bank. 
Notice the importance of community and society. 
The firm also lists very noble goals including poverty alleviation and environment protection. 
Its mission statement reads: “In China Merchants Bank (“CMB”), we firmly believe that the company and the community are mutually-interdependent. 
CMB plays a role to facilitate the economic growth of the country and in return, the national economic and social development helps us to expand.

Therefore, we stick to our principle of “From the society, to the society” and have taken various measures to give back to the society, such as in the areas of poverty alleviation, environmental protection, education and emergency relief services.” From Canada, the Canadian National Railway was selected as a good example of a comprehensive mission statement.

Companhia Sideurgica’s mission is: “To stand out as an icon for Brazil in terms of entrepreneurship and citizenship, as well as to increase the company values for the shareholder in a sustainable manner, by keeping focus on the steel industry, and on the mining and infrastructure industries, therefore contributing for a competitive advantage with regards to the company growth, besides offering products and services of quality, having an ethical relation with its workers, suppliers, customers, and with the communities in which the company operates at, in addition to being in harmony with the environment.” Finally, the company selected from India is Oil & Natural Gas.

SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS The tables in this paper, especially tables 5 and 6, summarize the current status of mission statements in the ten countries under review. 
It is important for both business and Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 educational professionals to be aware of the current philosophy of large corporations from around the world. 
The analysis of the content of mission statements provides insight into what these firms consider to be most important to them both in terms of stakeholders and desired goals or objectives. 
The authors would like to conclude this paper with the following observations: 1. For U.S. firms, the term “community or communities” has become commonly used in mission statements over the past eleven years (down from the high in 2010) See Table 4. Concern for communities in which the firm operates is commonly included in current mission statements. 
Customers have constantly been the most commonly mentioned stakeholder from 2001 through 2012. 
2. U.S. mission statements stress ethics and ethical practices to a significant degree increasing since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
Also, the desire to maintain a leadership position in the firm’s industry has continued to increase as a stated goal. 3. Reviewing all ten countries allows for a number of observations to be made: a. The most commonly identified stakeholder continues to be the customer ranging from a high of 76% in Australia and followed closely by the U.K. with 72%. 
The U.S. and France are next with 68% each. 
b. The importance of community or communities is evident in the mission statements from 2012. 
52% of Australian statements include this stakeholder followed by Brazil (32%), India (28%), and the U.S. (28%). 
Community was only mentioned in 8% of Japanese missions and 4% of German statements. 
c. Employees are an identified stakeholder in 52% of Australian statements followed by Canada (48%), Brazil (44%) and the U.K. (36%). 
d. Stockholders were most often included in Australian (52%), Brazilian (44%), and Chinese (40%) missions. 
Stockholders were only mentioned in 20% of U.S. and 12% of French statements. 
e. Turning to the identified goals, core values were included in more French missions (35%) than any of the other nine countries. 
f. Consideration for the environment and operating in an earth friendly manner was most reported in Brazilian (32%) missions followed by those from Australia (28%) and India (24%). 
Concern for the environment was found in only 8% of the missions from the U.S. and U.K. g. The goal of maintaining and improving innovation appears to be more common among all of the countries. 
Both the U.K. and Germany had 32% of its mission statements identifying this goal. h. Maintaining a leadership position in the industry was a common goal in the missions of firms in Canada and India (both 44%), U.K. (36%), and the U.S. (32%). 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 i. Production of a quality product or service continues to be a common goal of firms around the world. 
44% of Chinese firms, 40% of German companies, and 32% of U.S. enterprises included this as an identified goal. j. Goals that have begun to appear on global mission statements include affordability and teamwork. 
12% of U.S. companies included affordability on their mission statement. 
Also, 20% of French firms mentioned the importance of teamwork. 
12% of Australian and Indian missions also identified teamwork as a goal of the firm. 
k. Finally, Chinese mission statements have emphasized the importance of “harmony or creating a harmonious situation” in their missions. 
Harmony between the firm and society or the environment is increasingly more common. 
In summary, Tables 5 and 6 present a wealth of information. 
There are a number of other observations that could be made but the authors feel that these are most of the significant areas. 
Mission statements are constantly under review and need to be updated on a regular basis. 
The authors hope to continue their stream of mission statement research in future years to identify changes that are taking place in the written missions of organizations from around the world.
