T he report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in Canada states that the participation of Indigenous peoples in health care applying Indigenous knowledge and tradition as they consider appropriate should be the basis for developing policy for improved health. 
1,i Little data is available on outcomes of people working with traditional North American healers using Indigenous knowledge systems for healing. 
Even less is known about what happens when people from outside traditional cultures interact with traditional healers. 
This study aims to fill some of that gap. 
“Long before the existence of science-based health care, culturally defined healers served people within communities. 
The functions of healing often blended with those of spiritual leadership.” 2 Culturally defined healers continue to operate in most of the world, including North America, and to various degrees, depending upon the healer and the community, they blend traditional healing practices with those of the dominant religion in the region (primarily Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism). 
Varying by region, healers practice more or less openly and more or less in conjunction with science-based health professionals. 
Nonindigenous peoples are seeking out these healers more often, especially for conditions that carry dire prognoses, such as cancer, and usually after science-based medicine has failed. 
3 Engels 4 helped to explain this phenomenon in his writings about the implicit assumptions of science-based medicine, which actually may not apply to chronic illness. 
5-7 Pargament argues that people are goal-directed, striving for the things that are significant to them: psychological, social, physical, and material. 8 Spirituality refers to those aspects of this striving that relate to God, the Divine, the Universe, the Largest Whole, Higher Beings, and/or those things that people believe to be sacred. 
Spirituality is a process: a verb and not a noun, active instead of passive, in motion rather than static. 
Pargament describes three processes in the search for the sacred: (1) discovery (ie, searching or pursuing); (2) conservation (ie, sustaining oneself in times of crisis and preserving a sense of meaning through spiritual beliefs and practices); and (3) transformation (ie, profound change or, giving up some sources of meaning and discovering new sources of significance as changes take place in life). 
Stories abound regarding healing and curing that occurred in association with spiritual transformation, both in dominant religions and in Indigenous spirituality. 
SpiRiTuAliTy And Coping Spirituality represents one way to improve coping strategies and is also a component of quality of life. 
9 Spiritual and existential well-being is associated with higher quality of life, better physical health, and enjoyment of life even as individuals experience symptoms from disease or its treatment. 
9-13 Fulfillment of spiritual and existential needs and restoration of spiritual equilibrium are correlated with statistically significant improvement in resilience and level of reported personal growth. 
14-17 Studies of Spiritual Healing Questions about religious or spiritual healing—the extent to which it occurs and the degree to which it affects physiology—also are important. 
Csordas conceived religious healing as a form of discourse embodying a cultural rhetoric and capable of performing three essential persuasive tasks; that is, it creates (1) a predisposition to be healed, (2) the experience of spiritual empowerment, and (3) a concrete perception of personal transformation. 
18 This threefold process activates and controls healing processes internal to the person seeking healing and either redirects his or her attention toward new aspects of his or her actions and experiences or alters the manner in which he or she attends to accustomed aspects of those actions and experiences. 
The result is the creation of both a new worldview and a new sense of spiritual meaning for the person. 
Though Csordas was studying Catholic Pentecostals, the analysis is equally applicable to Aboriginal healing and directs our attention to those aspects of the treatment’s environment and the interaction with the healer that foster these three persuasive tasks. 
Studies of Spiritual Transformation Within the broad area of spirituality and spiritual healing, an important area for further research is that of spiritual transformation, which refers primarily to a fundamental change in the significance of the place or the character of the sacred in an individual’s life, and secondarily, to a fundamental change in the pathways that a person takes to the sacred. 
8 Spiritual transformation has a substantive focus upon the sacred as the individual perceives it and includes a profound change in a person’s sense of higher purpose and meaning. 
Spiritual transformation often involves a reorganization of religious values. 
19 Recent research has suggested that the specific ways in which people rediscover meaning in times of crisis may be less important than the process itself, and the ability to ascribe new meaning to a changed world through spiritual transformation, religious conversion, or existential change may be more significant than the specific content. 
20 Spiritual change and spiritual transformation could be important in improving physical health and decreasing incidence of illness. 
Hardy studied the operative cognitive and affective elements in 3000 cases of spiritual transformation. 
21 Spiritual transformation was most commonly preceded by (1) being in a state of depression and despair (183.7 per 1000); (2) artistic experiences, such as being stimulated by reading great literature, being moved by attending a dramatic performance, or by existentially confronting the possibility of death (82 per 1000); (3) having an illness (80 per 1000); and (4) listening to music (56.7 per 1000). 
(Hardy distinguished music from other artistic performances.) Spiritual transformation provided various benefits to people: (1) a sense of security, protection, Because this study was done in Canada, we will use the Canadian convention of i. referring to the traditional and original peoples of North America as Aboriginal instead of using the more common US term Native American. 
and peace; (2) a sense of joy, happiness, and well-being; (3) a sense of certainty, clarity, and enlightenment; (4) a sense of guidance, vocation, and inspiration; and (5) a sense of presence (spiritual, other). 
The consequences of the experience for the 3000 cases were (1) a sense of purpose or new meaning in life (184.7 per 1000); (2) changes in attitudes toward others (77 per 1000); and (3) changes in religious beliefs (38.7 per 1000). 
Garrett used the language of spiritual transformation to explain recovery from anorexia nervosa, noting that the most recovered anorexics question prevailing medical definitions of anorexia as well as the clinical criteria for recovery. 
22 Garrett understood anorexia and recovery to be the negative and positive phases, respectively, of a ritual of self-transformation. 
In Western culture, where appropriate myths and rituals for reentering the ordinary world are not readily available following a period of symbolic fasting, it is not surprising that recovery from anorexia is not automatic. 
The study’s participants referred to anorexia as a spiritual quest. Recovery involved a rediscovery (or creation) of a threefold connection: (1) to the self, (2) to others, and (3) to nature and/or the spiritual realm. 
These connections are the defining features of spirituality. 
The negative phase of the ritualistic quest (anorexia) involves a confrontation with the inevitability of death as a condition of the positive phase (recovery), in which people actively choose life. 
Garrett saw recovery from anorexia as constituting an active and metaphorical rebellion against forces of social control with anorexia being seen as an exaggeration of these forces (the demand to be thin and attractive, etc). 
Specific rituals affect the self-transformation from suffering to recovery, a series of steps as applicable to depression as to anorexia. 
Studies of Religious Practice Religion, which is not synonymous with spirituality, has shown positive correlations with good health, 8,23-25 although few studies’ designs used treatment outcomes to compare religious or spiritual interventions with their secular counterparts. 
26 These investigations included an 8-year study that evaluated data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). 
27 The study showed that an additional 8 years of life expectancy was associated with regularly attending religious services compared with never attending, even after adjustment for initial health status and a large set of social and behavioral risk factors. 
These effects of religious attendance were consistent across all ages, genders, and racial and ethnic groups and for all major causes of death. 
A second mortality study from Utah found 3 to 7 times as many suicides among male nonmembers and less active members of the Mormon Church as compared to active members. 
28 A third study of 87 elderly inpatients diagnosed with depression found that those with higher levels of intrinsic religiosity had significantly shorter times to remission than those who were less religious. 
For every 10-point increase in their measure of intrinsic religiosity on a 50-point scale, the time to recovery increased by 70%. 
29 In a regional US sample of elderly people, frequent attendance of religious services was a strong predictor of better physical functioning at yearly evaluations for up to 6 years later. 
Some groups were followed up to 12 years with persistence of the effect. 
30 Publication of more extensive reviews has occurred. 
3132 Idler discussed the methodological issues that have led to some apparent inconsistencies in the literature as well as the measurement problems inherent in studies of spirituality and religiosity. 
33 No studies have been done with Aboriginal populations or populations who attend traditional ceremonies to relate religiosity to length of life, and few studies have evaluated the effects of daily prayer among Aboriginal peoples. 
Studies have confirmed the importance of religion to people in the United States; 73% of Americans aged 61 years and older pray at least once every day 34 compared with 54% overall. 
35,36 Many Americans believe that a connection exists between religion and health: 79% believe that God answers prayers for healing from incurable diseases, 36 25% pray regularly for healing for their own illnesses, 37 and 64% think doctors should pray with a patient if the patient requests it. 38 The effects of prayer, however, are also understudied and rarely are studied as a bona fide intervention. 
Aboriginal Perspective The Aboriginal view of health and disease differs from that of mainstream Anglo-European culture, which views the two concepts as distinct opposites. 
Aboriginal cultures tend to view health and illness as facets of life, with an emphasis on the ideas that health is the result of harmony and balance and that healing is the move to restore harmony and balance when something disturbs them. 
Disturbances can occur in all aspects of relationships to multiple layers of reality, including the spiritual. Disease is not to be avoided, blocked, or suppressed. 
Rather, Aboriginal cultures appreciate it as part of a process of personal and spiritual transformation. 
People become ill because something is out of harmony and balance in their relationships. 
This imbalance can occur in a wide range of areas, including relationships with food, the environment, family members, the spiritual world, ancestors, the Creator, work, and more. 
Disease is a meaningful state that helps people heal. Health problems lead to a search for meaning and purpose, for living more fully and strongly within a simultaneously geographical and spiritual environment. 
In this view, diabetes becomes an issue of meaning. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses this categorization and makes it clear that such diseases of meaning will become the major causes of suffering and death worldwide in this century. 
39 To deal with these diseases, WHO asserts that the world will need more than the usual biomedical model of healing. 
Individuals will need approaches that reconstitute meaning and lead to different types of relationships between people and between people and the environment, both animate and inanimate. 
This approach can lead to new bridges between science and spirituality, antiquity and modernity, and Indigenous and modern cultures. 
Traditional healing takes the form of mutually helpful interactions 40 rather than an expert-driven top-down protocol. 
Help often occurs among participants as they wait together to be “doctored” by the traditional healer or wait for stones to heat in sweat lodge ceremonies. 
The culture of traditional North American healing is more group focused than individually oriented. 
It more resembles Alcoholics Anonymous than conventional medicine. 
Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown to be effective with regard to spirituality and social support. 
41 Stevenson 42 has documented the stories Saskatchewan healing elders tell about their practices and views on health and illness, curing and disease, and their relatedness to conventional medicine. 
Linkleter 43 has written in-depth about 10 Canadian traditional Indigenous healers, their philosophies of approach, their training, and their ways of interfacing with conventional Canadian culture. 
MeThodS Participants Since 1980, Dr Mehl-Madrona, a member of this study’s research team, has helped people who are seeking traditional healing to make contact with healers and to immerse themselves in local healing practices of a particular community. 
He has previously published the results of a study involving 105 people who participated in traditional Aboriginal healing. 
3 The study’s nonrandomized group of 150 non-Aboriginal participants had requested that Mehl-Madrona help them find and connect with traditional Aboriginal healers. 
Cancer was the most common reason people sought a traditional healer (Table 1), followed by anxiety-related complications. 
The study’s participants represented an enriched population, motivated to seek spiritual change, and therefore, more amenable to it than a general, naïve population. 
In that respect, the study is representative of seekers rather than all people. 
The team randomly selected participants from an electronic health record database to match groups of participants with the same disease for age, socioeconomic status (based upon type of insurance), and gender. 
Control groups included 150 people undertaking a spiritual retreat and 1200 comparison participants (100 for each condition). 
Comparison participants received conventional health care. 
They also may have received alternative health care or traditional healing, but the study did not provide that information. 
Thus, a bias existed that could reduce the significance of the work with traditional healers since members of the comparison group also could have worked with other healers. 
The research team assessed the selected participants for outcomes over 5 years using the same scale as the team used for retreat participants. 
The database used provided no identifying data whatsoever. 
Healers The current study used a variety of traditional healers known to Mehl-Madrona from his work in the Canadian Prairie provinces. 
Not all were part of the tribes originally found in those areas, but those tribes (Ojibway, Nakota, Dakota, Lakota, Cree, Dine, Blood, and Blackfoot) were represented. 
Though a well-defined set of procedures and interventions characterize various Aboriginal healing systems, healers typically apply them on an individualized basis. 
3,5,44 Design Before participants met with the traditional healers, they were interviewed and asked to write two stories. 
To prepare participants for this writing, the research team provided them with questions as a guide (Appendix A). The team reviewed each participant’s answers and discussed them with him or her, making additional notes about the answers. 
Participants’ first task was writing the story of their lives. 
The second task was writing the story of their illnesses from the perspective of the disease. 
Subsequent to participants’ work with the traditional healers, the research team interviewed the participants again and asked them to repeat this writing task and then compared the two sets of stories. 
The team also asked questions to flesh out the story of what happened during the encounters with the healers (Appendix B). Their stories provided rich information about the process of spiritual transformation and the ways in which it may be associated with improvements in physical health. 
Participants usually attended at least one sweat lodge ceremony and other ceremonies unique to the involved healers. 
Mehl-Madrona sometimes attended as well. 
Participants were asked to keep a journal and were invited to use artistic media to document their experiences. 
Aboriginal practices usually included (1) storytelling, (2) daily prayer ceremonies and rituals, including some usage of the sacred pipe, and (3) sweat lodge. 
Other ceremonies were unique to particular tribes, including the luwonpi and yuwipi (Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota), the shaking tent ceremony (Ojibway), and the vision quest and the Sun Dance (most Plains tribes). 
ouTCoMe MeASuReS Mehl-Madrona et al provide a detailed review of the analytic methods, rating teams, and psychometric properties employed in this study. 
45 Using modified grounded theory and dimensional analysis, they found the following categories of spiritual transformation: Report of major changes in sense of self, beliefs, and 1. quality of life. 
Increased sense of security, protection, and peace. 
2. Increased sense of joy, happiness, and well-being. 
3. Increased sense of belongingness in the Universe; a sense 4. of containment; a sense of connectedness with the spiritual world. 
Increased sense of guidance and inspiration from spiritual 5. sources. 
Increased faith and hope. 
6. Increased sense of spirituality manifested by: 7. Prayer more important. 
a. Connection to Nature more important. 
b. Stronger desire to feel close to God, Spirit, etc. 
c. outcomes as in Mehl-Madrona’s similar study. 
3 It consisted of a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from Cured (+2), Better (+1), No different (0), Worse (–1), or Dead (–2). 
The research team made the comparisons using log-likelihood methods and chi-squares. 
The team calculated the scores by multiplying the outcome scores by the number of participants for each group and then averaging across all participants. 
Results The median age decile for participants was 40 to 49 years with a total number of 155 (Table 1). At 5-year follow up interviews, 36.1% of participants reported resolution of their health problem, 35.5% reported improvement, 14.8% reported no change, 5.2% reported worsening of the condition, while 9.0% had succumbed to their illness (Table 2). Cancer was the most common reason why people sought a traditional healer, followed by anxiety disorders, autoimmune disorders, and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. 
To benchmark these results we compared them to similar patients randomly selected from an electronic database without identifying data who had the same diagnosis, age within the same decile, sex, and educational level (a marker of socioeconomic status). 
There were 155 people seeking traditional healers and 1500 comparison patients (100 for each condition). 
Comparisons were made with log-likelihood methods and chi-squares. 
The score was calculated by multiplying the outcome score by the number of patients and then averaging across all patients. 
When outcomes for people seeking traditional healing were compared to outcomes of patients who were receiving conventional treatments for the same illnesses, we saw that the people seeking traditional healing were certainly no worse off than the people receiving conventional care. 
We expected people seeking traditional healing to do better than those receiving conventional care because of their motivation and their effort to find healers. 
It does appear that these 156 patients did not suffer as a result of seeking traditional healing.

Materials available to the research team for rating included transcripts of the interviews, the participants’ writings, any artwork produced, and follow-up phone conversations. 
The research team contacted participants at regular intervals (usually every 6 months for 5 years) after their interactions with the healers to obtain updates to the stories of their unfolding lives. 
The follow-up phone calls included participants’ personal ratings of their medical outcomes. 
The research team interviewed at least two other family members for concordance and contacted at least one medical practitioner for corroboration of diagnosis and outcome. 
The study used the same simple scale for following Table 3.

Sample stories illustrating levels of spiritual transformation are provided as Appendix A. There were 155 people experiencing traditional healing and 1500 comparison patients (100 for each condition). 
Comparisons were made with log-likelihood methods and chi-squares. 
The score was calculated by multiplying the outcome score by the number of patients and then averaging across all patients (Table 3). Next we tabulated each person’s level of spiritual transformation by the degree of change in their underlying medical condition over the 5 years of follow-up. 
Using chisquare testing with corrections for multiple comparisons, it appeared that higher levels of spiritual transformation were associated with greater levels of physiological improvements (Table 4). Pearson’s chi-square was calculated to determine the likelihood that these results would be due to change and was 33.514, significant at P = .001. 
The value of the test for a linear-by-linear association was 20.604 (P < .001), and the likelihood ratio was 35.969 (P < .001). 
The level of spiritual transformation, which was assessed in the first year of the 5 years of follow-up, was associated with improved medical outcome in the fifth year of follow-up, satisfying the sequential requirement for establishing the possibility of causality. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the results of non-Native peoples seeking traditional North American Indigenous healing. 
It also represents a beginning to assess the beliefs of traditional healers that their work is through spiritual means. 
We used mixed methods to reliably numerically rate the level of spiritual transformation and then followed people over 5 years to ascertain their medical outcome, using a simple, reliable scale. 
The study supports the need for further refinement in methodology and continued accumulation of cases, which will require significantly greater funding that has previously been available in these areas. 
We believe that our preliminary results justify the need for further investigations. 
Important questions are brought out by this study. 
How important is the faith the seeker places in the healer? 
Does traveling to find a healer improve outcome? 
Is outcome actually improved when people seek exotic (to their culture) alternatives to what is ordinarily offered them? 
Is it possible to assign people randomly to traditional North American healing? 
Would the healers agree? 
Would the people wanting healing comply? 
These issues are often solved in other contexts by providing treatment free for those who are randomized. 
Traditional North American healing is typically by donation. 
No fee is charged per se. The smallest fee we’ve ever seen collected for healing is one cigarette. 
Therefore, access to care is not an issue. 
Limitations with this data arise from the context in which it was collected. 
These limitations make it impossible to assess the efficacy of traditional North American healing separate from the people who seek it, their motivations and interests in doing so, and the people who provide the healing. 
Variability existed in “dosing,” in the range of length of contact—from 1 to 21 days. 
People did varying amounts of work. 
Interestingly, the depth of spiritual transformation was not correlated with the length of contact with the healer. 
Some people seemed primed and ready. 
Others were not. 
The longest duration of contact was 21 days, and it was our sense that the man’s experience was minimal as was his spiritual transformation. 
Some people seeking contact with traditional healers did have profound spiritual experiences, many of which preceded physiological change. 
Diseases were cured (defined as 5 years without recurrence) in some cases and improved significantly in others. 
Despite conventional social upbringing, stories abounded of spirit and ancestor encounters, consistent with Native American philosophies. 
Anglo-Europeans appeared to have little trouble stepping into this other culture and participating rather fully. 
Outcome data was censored at 5 years. 
To fully address outcome beyond 5 years, survival type analysis should be used given that people with cancer may eventually die even though living much longer than expected as the result of a spiritual retreat. 
The same concerns may be true for other potentially life-threatening illnesses.
