1. Introduction Two lines of educational research point to the importance of self-beliefs in education. 
First, Lee (2009) and Lee and Stankov (submitted for publication) analyzed the non-cognitive variables assessed by the Programme for International School Assessment (PISA) in 2003. 
They showed that three mathematical self-belief constructs – self-efﬁcacy, self-concept and anxiety – are the best non-cognitive predictors of individual achievement in mathematics. 
Together these three account for approximately 16% of the variance in mathematics achievement – better than twelve different measures of motivation, learning strategies and attitudes to school (Lee & Stankov, submitted for publication). 
At the between-country level, Lee (2009) also showed that although Confucian Asians have the highest mathematics achievement scores among all 41 PISA 2003 countries, they tend to be ranked at the bottom on measures of self-efﬁcacy and self-concept (collectively referred to as self-doubt) and correspondingly high on anxiety.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2012.11.002 More recently, two independent studies based on large samples of Secondary 3 (mean age $15 years) students from Singapore measured mathematics achievement in relation to a range of non-cognitive variables including motivation and personality, and also found self-belief constructs to be the best predictors of achievement. 
These studies both added a measure of post-item conﬁdence that has a long history in psychology but had not been included in previous large-scale educational studies. 
This proved to be the strongest predictor in each case (Stankov, Lee, Luo, & Hogan, 2012; Stankov, Morony, & Lee, in press). 
In both studies conﬁdence alone accounted for the major part of variance explained by the selfbeliefs, with self-efﬁcacy and anxiety combined accounting for only 1%, and self-concept itself capturing a miniscule amount of incremental variance. 
The present paper combines these two lines of research on non-cognitive variables, to determine whether measures of conﬁdence add comparable incremental validity over the aforementioned three self-belief constructs in an international sample. 
1.1. 
Self-belief constructs There has been considerable debate concerning the deﬁnitions, speciﬁcity, and overlap between the different self-belief constructs mentioned above (see e.g. 
Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Ferla, Valcke, & Cai, 2009). 
We take the view that although there is considerable overlap between the constructs, they are conceptually and empirically distinct (Lee & Stankov, submitted for publication). 
We brieﬂy review these constructs below. 
1.1.1. 
Self-efﬁcacy Self-efﬁcacy is deﬁned as a person’s belief in their ability to bring about desired speciﬁc outcomes (Bandura, 1997). 
According to Bandura (1997) ‘‘A self-efﬁcacy assessment . 
. 
. 
includes both an afﬁrmation of a capability level and the strength of that belief’’ (p. 282). 
According to Pajares (1996) it can be measured on a broad or on an item-speciﬁc level; how ever , self-efﬁcacy judgments that are more item-speciﬁc have more predictive power (Chen & Zimmerman, 2007). 
Thus self-efﬁcacy measures tend to be domain-speciﬁc (see Bandura, 2006 for guidelines on scale development) and participants are not asked to compare themselves with others (Bandura, 1997; Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Pajares, 1996). 
For example, in PISA 2003 students were presented a series of hypothetical mathematics-related items (e.g. ‘‘calculate the number of tiles needed to cover a ﬂoor’’) and asked ‘‘how conﬁdent are you that you could solve this (type of problem)’’. 
According to Bandura (1993, 1997), self-efﬁcacy (or conﬁdence to attain future outcomes) predicts choice of activity, effort expenditure, thought patterns (such as dwelling on negative outcomes) and emotional reactions such as stress and depression. 
1.1.2. 
Self-concept Self-concept is positively correlated with self-efﬁcacy, and reﬂects a more general sense of how well a person thinks she/he performs at a school subject or set of tasks. 
Measures of self-concept reﬂect a student’s self-comparison to his or her immediate peers (i.e., frames of reference) and involve cognitive and affective evaluations of the self (Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Marsh, 1992; Schunk & Pajares, 2005). 
The normative qualities of self-concept measures were highlighted in PISA 2003 (Lee, 2009; OECD, 2004) and subsequent large-scale international studies, in which some of the highest-performing (i.e., Japanese and Korean) students in the world expressed the lowest self-concept for mathematics, and some lower-performing countries had overall very high self-concept – the so-called ‘‘Big Fish Little Pond Effect’’ (see Mar sh, 1992). 
While mathematics self-concept directly targets feelings of competence regarding the subject discipline of mathematics, self-concept can also be measured in relation to critical skills underlying mathematics competence – namely memory and reasoning. 
The MARCI (Memory and Reasoning Competence Inventory; see Kleitman & Stankov, 2007) measures selfconcept about memory and reasoning abilities. 
To the extent that these abilities are relevant for performance on tests of mathematics, MARCI and self-concept in mathematics should be related. 
1.1.3. 
Anxiety Self-efﬁcacy and self-concept in their negative form (collectively, self-doubt) are highly related to anxiety, which refers to one’s physiological and affective responses when performing or thinking about a task. 
Mathematics anxiety can be thought of as a domain-speciﬁc anxiety related to, or directed toward, mathematics. 
Several mechanisms have been postulated for the negative relationship between mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-concept and self-efﬁcacy. 
Firstly, students who ﬁnd mathematics anxiety-producing may seek to avoid those negative feelings by avoiding mathematics, thereby avoiding the practice needed to achieve mastery. 
Second, those who are already struggling with mathematics will ﬁnd it less enjoyable than those who are able to master it. Third, the anxious feelings use up working memory capacity, leaving fewer resources for anxious students to solve problems resulting in negative effects on performance. 
The anxious feelings will feed into self-concept (e.g., I think I am not good at mathematics). 
PISA 2003 identiﬁed a high prevalence of mathematics anxiety among 15-year-olds, particularly females. 
Notably, students in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands report low levels of anxiety in mathematics, and have a high level of mathematics performance overall (Lee, 2009; OECD, 2004). 
As a form of validation against existing international datasets this study will also examine gender differences in anxiety and other self-beliefs. 
1.1.4. 
Conﬁdence Conﬁdence ratings have not previously been elicited in large-scale international studies in education; nevertheless, the use of conﬁdence judgments in psychology has a long history, dating back to early psychophysics. 
Conﬁdence is typically assessed by asking the test-taker to indicate, on a percentage scale, how conﬁdent he or she is that their just-provided answer to a cognitive test item is correct. 
Multiple studies over 20 years have demonstrated that conﬁdence ratings from diverse cognitive tests tend to deﬁne a common factor, suggesting conﬁdence is a trait in adults (see Crawford & Stankov, 1996; Kleitman & Stankov, 2007; Stankov & Crawford, 1996a, 1996b, 1997; Stankov & Kleitman, 2008 for reviews; Stankov, Pallier, Danthiir, & Morony, 2012) and in school-aged children (Kleitman & Gibson, 2011; Kleitman & Moscrop, 2010). 
This empirical ﬁnding sets conﬁdence apart from other self-beliefs since it indicates domain generality of conﬁdence. 
At ﬁrst glance this may appear paradoxical since this is a self-assessment measure that is closely tied to a cognitive act and is therefore quite speciﬁc in nature. 
And yet, conﬁdence obtained from tasks that are quite different – e.g., measures of sensory processing and verbal problem solving – deﬁne a broad, possibly general, factor (e.g., Stankov, Pallier, et al., 2012). 
The elicitation of ongoing deliberate self-evaluations may have value in a learning environment; for example by helping students to correct distorted self-perceptions, or providing useful diagnostic information for teachers and schools, such as stronglyheld erroneous beliefs and topics or problems that students do not feel equipped to solve. 
In this way conﬁdence may also reﬂect a metacognitive monitoring process. 
The average of conﬁdence ratings over all items in the test – the conﬁdence score – can be compared to the percentage of correct answers in the test in order to assess the realism of the conﬁdence judgments (see e.g. 
Moore & Healy, 2008; Stankov, 2000). 
In this study we use a measure of realism known as the bias score, which is the difference between measures of conﬁdence (i.e., average conﬁdence over all items in a test) and accuracy (the percentage of correct answers in the test). 
1.1.5. 
Evaluation: post-test self-evaluation A second method encouraging students to reﬂect on performance is to ask them to estimate the number of items in the test they have completed correctly (for a recent use of this construct in an educational setting see Kim, Chiu, & Zhou, 2010). 
We include this self-evaluation (labeled ‘‘evaluation’’ in the present study) as an alternative self-assessment measure. 
Although conceptually similar to conﬁdence, both theoretical (e.g. 
Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Kleinbolting, 1991) and empirical (e.g. 
Stankov, 2000) arguments suggest that conﬁdence and evaluation represent different mental processes. 
1.2. 
Comparisons between self-concept and conﬁdence The main difference between these two constructs is in terms of the frames of reference – conﬁdence judgments are made in relationship to the just-completed task whereas self-concept involves comparison with other people. 
The measures of self-concept are akin to personality measures – they refer to one’s beliefs about their own habitual tendencies or dispositions. 
Another difference is in terms of domain speciﬁcity, with self-concept being speciﬁc in the sense that it is closely linked to a particular academic domain (English, mathematics, science). 
In contrast, conﬁdence is more general in the sense that empirical evidence points to a strong conﬁdence factor. 
1.3. 
Comparisons between self-efﬁcacy and conﬁdence For both constructs the word ‘‘conﬁdence’’ is used, and one difference is in timing: the self-efﬁcacy question is asked prior to a (hypothetical) cognitive act and conﬁdence is asked immediately after answering a cognitive item. 
Boekaerts and Rozendaal (2010) refer to the calibration of 10–11 year old primary school students’ mathematics self beliefs, in which postsolution judgments of accuracy (‘‘I am not conﬁdent at all. 
. 
.. I am very conﬁdent’’) were more accurate than ‘‘feeling of conﬁdence’’ before (‘‘I am conﬁdent I will ﬁnd a solution’’) problem solution. 
They argue this is because students’ metacognitive feelings during the mathematics task would have informed their judgments. 
Some studies refer to predictive and postdictive self-efﬁcacy beliefs (e.g. 
Chen & Zimmerman, 2007). 
Cramer, Neal, and Brodsky (2009) argue that the terms self-efﬁcacy and conﬁdence should not be used interchangeably, because the two constructs differ in important ways: whereas self-efﬁcacy refers to a person’s perception of their ability to conduct a particular behavior, self-conﬁdence reﬂects a degree of certainty about a perception, event, or outcome. 
Conceptually, conﬁdence can be seen as a self-belief construct, encompassing one’s perception of the difﬁculty of the test item, awareness of his/her own capabilities, and the likelihood that the just-provided answer is correct. 
1.4. 
Hypothesized structural model of the relationship among the self-belief constructs Although we see conﬁdence and evaluation measures as part of a broad self-belief domain, our approach in the present study is to treat them as measures of a separate latent Conﬁdence/Evaluation dimension. 
For reasons outlined above, a part of self-efﬁcacy is also expected to measure the same latent dimension. 
The three measures that are expected to load on a Conﬁdence/Evaluation factor all involve evaluations of competence. 
The second latent dimension we expect to emerge is the Self-beliefs. 
This dimension follows from Lee’s (2009) ﬁndings regarding the relationship between self-efﬁcacy, self-concept and anxiety, and it represents the affective elements of selfdoubt and anxiety. 
Again, the self-beliefs that are captured by this dimension are similar to personality questionnaires in that they ask for endorsement of general statements about one’s perceptions of himself/herself. 
The speciﬁcity of the judgments, or the frame of reference in which they are made, separates the six variables into the two latent dimensions. 
Fig. 1 depicts the relationship among the measures employed in this study. 
For reasons outlined above, the two latent factors in Fig. 1 are related and both are expected to predict mathematics achievement scores. 
This model is ﬁtted in a later section of this paper. 
1.5. 
Aims The aims of the current study are threefold: 1. To replicate ﬁndings from PISA 2003 concerning measures of mathematics self-beliefs across countries, regions, and gender, focusing on (a) patterns of means; (b) relationship among the measures. 
2. To investigate the place of conﬁdence in relation to other non-cognitive self-belief constructs in the prediction of mathematics performance in an international sample. 
3. To develop a structural model of non-cognitive self-constructs that is consistent across cultures. 
2. Method The data reported in this paper were collected as part of a larger study on a wide range of non-cognitive variables including personality and social attitudes. 
In this paper we focus exclusively on self-beliefs related to mathematics achievement. 
The study was administered from Singapore, where all (online) data collection, cleaning, and analysis took place. 
The foreign collaborators – all situated in the education or psychology departments of universities in their own country – were responsible for translation of the survey documents into the languages of their sample, sampling schools and classes, and managing data collection, following procedures developed in Singapore. 
Translations were conducted by each foreign research team, followed by a review of the translation for ﬂuency and faithfulness by a native speaker of that language (also a member of the foreign research team). 
Translation review, or double translation (rather than back-translation) is the method used in large-scale educational studies such as PISA and TIMSS (OECD, 2005). 
Clear instructions regarding the translation and review of items were sent to collaborators. 
The Chinese instruments used in Hong Kong and Taiwan were both based on the same translation. 
Reliability statistics were excellent for all scales reported here (see Table 2). The data cleaning process included inspection of the distribution of each item in each country, together with factor analysis and reliability analysis on each scale in each country. 
2.1. 
Participants Participants were 7167 students from nine countries in Europe and East Asia, who were in the third year of secondary school (modal age 15.1) at the time of data collection. 
Research coordinators in each country were instructed to select a mix .65 .57 .75 .91 .33 .43 -.66 .56 .94 Accuracy Maths self efficacy Maths self concept Maths Anxiety Evaluation Confidence SelfBelief s Confidence /Evaluation / MARCI Fig. 1. Structural model with pancultural loadings. 
of ‘‘urban’’ schools 1 that would approximate mean population values in terms of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and ability rankings, and to avoid highly advantaged or disadvantaged schools. 
Participating schools were required to have computers with Internet access; this resulted in a biased sample in at least one country (Serbia, in which the majority of schools were wealthier schools in the capital Belgrade). 
Across countries, the mean age was 15.39 and there were exactly 50% girls. 
Detailed sample information for each country is presented in Table 1. One aim of the study was to look at differences between students in Confucian Asia and Europe on a range of measures. 
Confucian Asian countries were Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. 
All these countries consistently perform in the top 10 of TIMSS and PISA mathematics assessment (Lee, 2009; Stankov, 2010). 
European countries that had performed well in previous rounds of PISA and TIMMS were Denmark, Finland, and The Netherlands. 
Poor-performing European countries were Latvia and Serbia – the Latvian sample was large enough to be split into two separate language and ethnic groups – Latvians and Russians. 
Mean PISA 2009 mathematics scores for each country are also reproduced in Table 1. PISA scores are expressed on a scale that has a mean of 500 and standard deviation of 100. 
The average score based on 2009 data for the four Confucian countries in our sample is 551.5 and for the three high-scoring European countries it is 523.3 (Cohen’s d = .28). 
The mean in Finland is about as high as those of the Confucian countries. 
In PISA 2003 the difference between top scoring European countries and Confucian countries was only 8 points; for PISA 2009 the differences between the 6 Confucian and 3 European countries in the top 10 was 19 points, resulting in a small Cohen’s d of .19. 
The only European country in our study that was in the PISA 2009 top ten for mathematics is Finland. 
When we include lower-performing Latvia and Serbia in our European sample (PISA 2009 mean = 498.8) the difference between Confucian and European countries (Cohen’s d = .53) is much larger. 
Table 1 indicates that mean ages across countries are similar; the largest difference in age is 1.19 years between Finland and Hong Kong, who collected data at different times during the school year. 
If the ﬁndings are consistent with previous large-scale studies, we may assume that these differences in age will not affect our overall conclusions. 
2.2. 
Survey instruments The survey was conducted online using Qualtrics survey software. 
It consisted of approximately 200 statements, interspersed with mathematics questions (and conﬁdence ratings). 
This paper is only concerned with four scales from the survey, plus 10 mathematics items and one self-evaluation item. 
To minimize order effects the four scales in this study were presented on three survey pages, and presentation of both pages (within the survey) and items (within the page) was randomized. 
In total each survey had 25 pages, with each mathematics item and corresponding conﬁdence rating presented on a separate page. 
The overall self-evaluation (‘‘Evaluation’’) was presented at the end of the survey. 
Stems and items for each scale are listed in Table 3 and reliability statistics for the scales in each country are presented in Table 2. Alpha reliabilities are excellent for the non-cognitive scales and acceptable for the mathematics test. One reason for the lower reliabilities for the mathematics accuracy test is the small number of items relative to the breadth of the construct – by contrast, PISA 2003 had 85 mathematics items. 
2.2.1. 
Mathematics self-efﬁcacy The eight items that form this scale were taken directly from Question 31 of the PISA 2003 Student Questionnaire (SQ). 
Responses ranged from not very conﬁdent (1) to very conﬁdent (4). 
Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the sample.

The exceptions were Denmark and The Netherlands, which are small, densely populated countries with no great ‘‘urban/rural’’ distinction. 
Thus students may live in small villages, but these villages are always a relatively short distance from urban centers. 
2.2.2. 
Mathematics self-concept Five items from this scale were taken directly from PISA 2003 (SQ question 32) and the remainder were piloted with Singaporean students in late 2009. 
These ten items were intermixed on the same survey page as the Memory and Reasoning Self-Concept Inventory (MARCI, see below). 
Responses ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). 
2.2.3. 
Memory and Reasoning Self-Concept (MARCI) This short version of the scale developed by Kleitman and Stankov (2007) used 8 items – four memory and four reasoning. 
2.2.4. 
Mathematics anxiety This ﬁfteen-item scale consisted of ﬁve items from PISA 2003 and an additional 10 items that were piloted in Singapore in 2009, and used the same response options as the self-concept scales. 
2.2.5. 
Mathematics items (accuracy) Nine mathematics items from the PISA released items (Salz & Figueroa, 2009; items M467Q01, M266Q01, M484Q01, M510Q01, M468Q01, M267Q01, M307Q01, M543Q01, M509Q01) and one from TIMSS 2007 (Mullis, Martin, & Foy, 2008, p. 107) were interspersed at random throughout the survey. 
Items were selected partly for ease of programming and scoring, and were scored 0 or 1. The accuracy scores presented in Tables 4–6 are expressed as percentages. 
2.2.6. 
Conﬁdence Conﬁdence rating scales were presented on the same page as mathematics items. 
Before proceeding to the next page, participants were asked ‘‘How conﬁdent are you that your answer is correct?’’; they responded on an 11-point rating scale anchored at 0% (‘‘just guessing’’) and 100% (‘‘absolutely certain’’). 
2.2.7. 
Evaluation (self-evaluation of performance) After the ﬁnal item was completed, participants were asked how many mathematics questions they thought they answered correctly. 
2.3. 
Procedure The survey was delivered online using Qualtrics survey software. 
Translated surveys were uploaded in Singapore and piloted by the foreign collaborators, who also had the option to add items of their own at the very end of the survey. 
Students completed the survey during their mathematics class. 
3. Results This section covers construct validity, country, region and gender differences, prediction of mathematics scores using multiple regression, and a Structural Equation Model (SEM) of the relationship among the constructs sampled in this study. 
3.1. 
Construct validity: factor structure among items Table 3 presents the PROMAX-rotated factor pattern matrix based on a maximum likelihood solution for the 51 noncognitive items. 
The solution is based on the total sample of participants from all countries – a pancultural analysis. 
The structure is remarkably clean and clear and the number of cross-loadings is very small. 
The factors are: (1) Mathematics Self-efﬁcacy; (2) Mathematics Self-concept; (3) Memory and Reasoning Self-Concept (MARCI); (4) Table 2 Cronbach’s coefﬁcients alpha for scales within each country.

.657 Mathematics Anxiety; and (5) Conﬁdence/Evaluation. 
These ﬁve factors account for around 52% of the total variance. 
Correlations among the factor s range from .213 to .61 3 indicating that the constructs are independent but related to each oth er. The analyses reported in the following sections are based on the composites (i.e., total scores) rather than factor scores. 
We repeated the exploratory factor analysis within each country. 
Factor solutions between countries were not identical; however, the correspondence was close enough for us to conclude that the measures tap the same construct in different countries. 
Analogous results – i.e., similar structure in pancultural and multigroup analyses – were reported in Stankov and Lee (2008). 
These solutions are not presented here. 
3.2. 
Country/region and gender differences Table 4 lists scale means for each country. 
The last (bias) column contains the difference between means for conﬁdence and accuracy that are available in the preceding two columns. 
Country means are also plotted in Figs. 
2–9 as curves labeled ‘‘Total’’. 
Country effects were signiﬁcant for all variables, as can be seen from the F-tests at the bottom of Table 4. 3.2.1. 
Differences between European and Confucian world regions To examine whether the differences between European and Confucian regions that were reported by Lee (2009) replicate in these data, we present in Table 5 arithmetic means for Confucian (Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan) and European (Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Serbia and Latvia) countries. 
In evaluating the effect sizes we consider both the F-tests and Cohen’s d (bottom two lines in Tables 5 and 6). We adopt the convention that Cohen’s d lower than .20 indicates effects that are too small to warrant consideration, effects between .20 and .40 are small but noteworthy and effects above .40 are moderate but deﬁnitely not negligible. 
The rank order of countries on PISA 2009 mathematics achievement in Table 1 and on accuracy scores in Table 4 is somewhat different; it is clear from Table 5 that Confucians (52.70) score higher than Europeans (42.15), producing moderate Cohen’s d = .41 and signiﬁcant F-test. Fig. 8 shows that, among Europeans, Danes and Dutch are very close to Confucians in mathematics performance and, as expected, Serbs and Latvians are at the bottom. 
The main unexpected ﬁnding is poor performance of Finnish participants. 
In this study, Finnish students obtained results comparable to those of Serbs and Latvians even though in several PISA studies Finland was among the top-scoring countries. 
From among the three main self-belief constructs, our data indicate that, as expected, Confucians score signiﬁcantly higher on Anxiety (Cohen’s d = À.40), the difference is small but noteworthy on the two measures of self-concept (Cohen’s Factor 1 Mathematics self-efﬁcacy 2 Mathematics self-concept 3 MARCI 4 Mathematics anxiety 5 Conﬁdence/Evaluation Factor intercorrelations 1 1.000 2 .569 1.000 3 .408 .465 1.000 4 À.390 À.613 À.213 1.000 5 .612 .508 .308 À.378 1.000 Table 4 Raw scale means for each and F-tests of differences between countries.

2 Thus, the ﬁndings with PISA 2003 reported by Lee (2009) clearly replicate for two out of three constructs. 
Close inspection of the country means in Table 4 indicates a similar pattern of results for self-efﬁcacy with those countries as was obtained in PISA 2003 (in which Singapore and Taiwan did not participate; see Lee, 2009, Fig. 2). The difference between the regions on conﬁdence is negligible (Cohen’s d = .12) and the inspection of countries’ means indicates that Confucian countries have a very similar average conﬁdence (around 60.00) to virtually all European countries Fig. 2. Gender and country differences on mathematics self-efﬁcacy.

but Finland (mean conﬁdence = 48.29 in Table 4). Turning to the derived bias score (Fig. 9), it is apparent that Confucians (9.08) are better calibrated than Europeans (16.89). 
Danes, Dutch and Finns have very similar average bias scores; the higher bias scores among Europeans can mostly be attributed to (overconﬁdent) Serb and Latvian students. 
Among Confucians, Hong Kong and Singapore have similar low bias scores indicating almost perfect calibration; Taiwanese students exhibit bias similar to the high-scoring Europeans; and Koreans – who performed worse than expected – exhibit bias scores in between the high and low-scoring Europeans.

Gender differences Table 6 presents arithmetic means for boys and girls in the total sample and in the bottom two rows F-tests and Cohen’s d values for every construct measured in this study. 
The main effect of gender is negligible for only one variable – males (mean = 47.56) and females (mean = 45.80) are practically equal in their mathematics achievement scores. 
At the same time, females show lower scores than males on all the positive non-cognitive measures and correspondingly high anxiety. 
Males Fig. 4. Gender and country differences on Memory and Reasoning Self-Concept (MARCI). 
Fig. 5. Gender and country differences on mathematics anxiety. 
are also more overconﬁdent than females as can be seen from the bias scores for the two genders. 
This is all consistent with the literature (Pallier et al., 2002) and thus supports the validity of these data. 
Figs. 
2–9 present plots of male and female scores for the ten national samples of this study. 
By and large, the lines for two genders are parallel for most constructs indicating relatively low interaction effects between country and gender. 
Perhaps the most notable observation is a small difference between males and females in Singapore in comparison to other countries: Fig. 6. Gender and country differences on Evaluation. 
Fig. 7. Gender and country differences on conﬁdence. 
there is minimal gender difference in Singapore with respect to self-efﬁcacy, anxiety, evaluation and conﬁdence measures. 
Differences are also relatively small on mathematics self-concept, and Singapore is the only country where females score higher than males on a test of achievement in mathematics (accuracy). 
Gender differences in Hong Kong are more pronounced than in other countries on measures of anxiety, mathematics self-concept and evaluation. 
The reasons for the lack of gender differences in self-beliefs in Singapore and comparatively larger gender differences in Hong Kong are unclear. 
In summary, the differences between countries, regions, and genders in the present study replicate the ﬁndings of PISA 2003 with respect to anxiety and self-concept and to a lesser extent with self-efﬁcacy. 
Conﬁdence, a new measure of selfbeliefs that has not been examined cross-culturally in PISA studies, shows small differences between regions but signiﬁcant difference between genders.

3.3. 
Predicting mathematics accuracy from self-beliefs: regression analyses As mentioned in the introductory part of this paper, the PISA 2003 data reveal signiﬁcant correlations between self-beliefs and Mathematics achievement scores (Lee, 2009; Lee & Stankov, submitted for publication). 
Correlations between self-belief constructs and accuracy scores for the present, pancultural, data are displayed in Table 7 and the ﬁrst column shows coefﬁcients relevant for our discussion. 
The three self-belief constructs that were important predictors of achievement in PISA 2003 each have signiﬁcant correlations with accuracy in the present study. 
Unsurprisingly, the lowest correlation is with Memory and Reasoning SelfConcept (MARCI, r = .17). 
Accuracy has high correlations with the new measures – post-test ‘‘evaluation’’ of the number of correctly solved items (r = .44) and conﬁdence (r = .60). 
We do not present correlational matrices for individual countries but the main features of these matrices can be easily summarized. 
The pattern of pancultural correlations presented in Table 7 is repeated in almost all groups: conﬁdence has the highest correlation followed by mathematics self-efﬁcacy and ‘‘evaluation’’ – although the order of these latter two varies. 
Only two groups do not follow this trend – for Serbs and Latvians (LVL) mathematics self-concept (rather than evaluation) is the second or third-most important correlate. 
These are the two national groups with the lowest mathematics performance. 
As can be expected, MARCI shares more common variance with mathematics self-concept (.53) than with any other variable. 
‘‘Evaluation’’ correlates more highly with conﬁdence (.68) than with any other variable. 
Table 8 presents the outcomes of regression analyses using accuracy as a criterion both within countries and at the pancultural level. 
The pancultural ﬁndings based on correlations in Table 7 are presented in the last two columns of Table 8. In the ﬁrst analysis, we regressed accuracy on mathematics self-efﬁcacy, mathematics self-concept, MARCI, and mathematics anxiety, and obtained an R-square value of .225 and standardized beta weights of .379, .166, À.094, and À.052 respectively. 
Clearly self-efﬁcacy is the strongest predictor of mathematics performance and can account for the majority of the 22% explained variance in mathematics accuracy. 
This is consistent with Lee’s (2009) and Lee and Stankov’s (submitted for publication) ﬁndings.

Clearly, the percentage of variance accounted for by the predictors has increased signiﬁcantly, R-squared becoming .390. 
By far the best predictor is conﬁdence, followed by self-efﬁcacy. 
In these data, MARCI appears to act as a suppressor variable, it has a negative (À.122) standardized beta coefﬁcient even though it correlated positively with accuracy in Table 6. From Table 8 it is apparent that the single most important predictor of mathematics accuracy in each country is conﬁdence. 
At the pancultural level, as well as in six out of ten national samples, the second most important predictor is selfefﬁcacy. 
Even though self-efﬁcacy and conﬁdence are conceptually related and empirically correlated, there is a small but signiﬁcant amount of variance captured by self-efﬁcacy that is not present in measures of conﬁdence. 
Notably, conﬁdence captures most of the variance in achievement that is explained by self-efﬁcacy and the other self-constructs combined, making conﬁdence a much more potent predictor of accuracy. 
Some might argue that the close correspondence between conﬁdence and accuracy items accounts for the superior prediction of conﬁdence. 
In analyses not reported here we split the conﬁdence and accuracy items into odd and even items and examined the predictive power of conﬁdence for odd items for accuracy of even items (and vic e versa). 
In a three-step regression analysis we entered conﬁdence (odd) in the ﬁrst step; all other self-belief variables in the second step; and conﬁdence (even) in the third step. 
At both the pancultural and individual country level Conﬁdence (odd) predicts Accuracy (even) almost as well as does Conﬁdence (even). 
Stankov, Lee, et al. (2012) went a step further. 
They used exam marks in mathematics obtained three months after the survey as a criterion and showed that conﬁdence remains a signiﬁcant predictor of exam marks even with the removal of the variance due to the accuracy scores that were used for the assessment of conﬁdence. 
Signiﬁcant incremental validity of conﬁdence was also reported by Stanko v and Lee (2008). 
3.4. 
Self-beliefs and mathematics accuracy: structural model We employed a structural modeling approach embodied in Mplus (Muthe ´ n & Muthe ´ n, 2007) to the model that was described in the introductory part of this paper and is shown in Fig. 1. According to this model, the non-cognitive variables in this study comprise two latent factors: Self-beliefs and Conﬁdence/Evaluation. 
Self-efﬁcacy loads on both factors; Selfbeliefs is also deﬁned by mathematics self-concept, Memory and Reasoning Self-Concept (MARCI), and mathematics anxiety. 
Conﬁdence/Evaluation is deﬁned predominantly by conﬁdence and evaluation scores. 
The Self-belief factor predicts Conﬁdence/Evaluation, but only the Conﬁdence/Evaluation factor predicts accuracy. 
Path coefﬁcients from the pancultural solution are reproduced in Table 9 and in Fig. 1. This solution has satisfactory ﬁt indices (CFI: .967, TLI: .942, RMSEA: .087; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .082–.093). 
By contrast, a single-factor solution (i.e. with all six predictor variables loading on one factor, which then predicts accuracy) resulted in poor ﬁt (CFI: .800, TLI: .700, RMSEA: .198; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .193–.203). 
In what is known as the multigroup solution, the model that was obtained in the pancultural solution was ﬁtted to all 10 national samples simultaneously in a test of conﬁgural invariance. 
This multigroup solution, also reproduced in Table 9, produced the following goodness-of-ﬁt indices: (CFI: .914, TLI: .910, RMSEA: .111; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .106– .115). 
When gender (rather than country) was used as the grouping variable the ﬁt was also acceptable: (CFI: .958, TLI: .947, RMSEA: .082; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .0877–.0897). 
Initially, we assumed that accuracy can be predicted by both Self-beliefs and Conﬁdence/Evaluation factors. 
However, the path coefﬁcient from the Self-beliefs factor to accuracy was non-signiﬁcant in seven countries and only one group (Latvian Russians) had a loading greater than .20. 
When arrows to accuracy are drawn from both the Self-beliefs and Conﬁdence/ Evaluation factors the ﬁt indices are as follows for the multigroup (CFI = .916, TLI = .907, RMSEA = .112; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .108, .117) and pancultural solution (CFI = .967, TLI = .936, RMSEA = .091; RMSEA 90% conﬁdence interval .085, .097). 
These ﬁt indices are inferior to those presented in Table 9 for solutions that do not contain a direct link between the Self-beliefs factor and accuracy.

Importantly, the two latent factors are highly related, yet the prediction of accuracy is due predominantly to the Conﬁdence/Evaluation factor. 
4. Discussion The ﬁrst aim of this study was to replicate the results of PISA 2003, which focused on cognitive and affective reactions to mathematics; the second was to extend measurement of self-belief constructs to include post-test measures of conﬁdence and self-evaluation for the ﬁrst time in a large international sample. 
Thirdly we aimed to develop a structural model of mathematical self-beliefs that is consistent across cultures and that improves prediction of mathematics performance over what is already known. 
Our ﬁndings support the view that the ability to accurately self-assess immediate past performance is a more salient indicator of performance than self-concepts, anxiety, and self-efﬁcacy. 
We argue that this is because asking students to reﬂect on an item or test just completed invokes different psychological processes including metacognitive monitoring, which may in turn prompt deeper reﬂection on the items just completed. 
We explore these themes below. 
4.1. 
Conﬁdence in relation to other non-cognitive self-belief constructs The results with the non-cognitive variables in this study replicated ﬁndings from PISA 2003 at both the between and within-country level. 
This clear replication is evidence for both the robustness of the constructs and the validity of the noncognitive data collected in this study. 
The only truly unexpected ﬁnding in our data is the notably poor performance of Finnish students on the mathematics test. Two explanations of poor Finnish results are plausible. 
First, that the sample included in our study was of lower ability than a representative sample of Finnish students. 
This is unlikely given the strong emphasis on equity in the Finnish school system and historical evidence that differences between Finnish schools tend to be small (see Ministry of Education and Culture). 
A second, more plausible interpretation is that the Finnish students were poorly motivated. 
This could be a consequence of collecting data very close to the end of the school year. 
Korean students also did not perform as well as expected, which may reﬂect a sampling issue – almost 40% of the sample was drawn from vocational schools, which cater to less academically capable students. 
This statistic is representative at a school level – approximately 40% of Korean high schools are vocational – but at a student level around 30% of students are enrolled in vocational schools (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, 2008). 
3 Perhaps the most striking ﬁnding from this study is the strength and consistency of the conﬁdence construct in relation to the other self-belief constructs that were studied in PISA 2003. 
In each of the countries surveyed in our study conﬁdence was the variable most closely related to accuracy, and conﬁdence could also account for most of the variance in mathematics performance that could be explained by self-efﬁcacy and other self-constructs. 
The multigroup analyses indicated that the same pattern of non-cognitive variables in relation to accuracy obtained irrespective of culture, gender, or educational system.

4.2. 
Differences between conﬁdence and other self-belief constructs One feature of these results is that as self-belief items go from the general to the speciﬁc, prediction of mathematics accuracy improves. 
In other words, the weakest predictor, MARCI, represents the general domain of memory and reasoning; mathematics self-concept and anxiety is domain-speciﬁc; mathematics self-efﬁcacy is task-speciﬁc, and conﬁdence – the strongest predictor – is item-speciﬁc. 
Some would argue that the levels of measurement alone are sufﬁcient to explain the results. 
We believe conﬁdence ratings may be evoking a different kind of knowledge or belief – we may refer to it as selfmonitoring – that is not being captured by the other ‘‘self-belief’’ constructs such as anxiety, self-efﬁcacy and self-concept. 
An important aspect of monitoring in comparison to other self-beliefs is in terms of the ‘frames of reference’. 
Monitoring is focused on the immediately preceding cognitive act whereas self-concept and anxiety evoke comparison of oneself with others. 
As measured in the present study, self-efﬁcacy is linked to a particular item but since the item is not attempted, one’s self-efﬁcacy has to be expressed with respect to some external or internal frame of reference as well (Marsh, 1986). 
The ‘‘Self-belief’’ factor in Fig. 1 comprised of self-concept and anxiety with a smaller loading from self-efﬁcacy – may represent affective beliefs about performance, and the ‘‘Conﬁdence/Evaluation’’ factor – comprised of conﬁdence, evaluation, and a smaller loading from self-efﬁcacy – may represent quasi-cognitive or metacognitive beliefs. 
Does this mean that conﬁdence ratings are just another aspect of cognitive ability? 
Evidence from a vast body of research suggests not. 
For example, Stankov and colleagues (Crawford & Stankov, 1996; Stankov, 1998, 2000; Stankov & Crawford, 1996a, 1996b, 1997; Stankov, Pallier, et al., 2012) have repeatedly shown that when young adults are given a series of cognitive (or even perceptual) tests that require conﬁdence ratings, the conﬁdence ratings form a separate factor to the cognitive tasks. 
In other words, although conﬁdence ratings are related to test performance, they are more related to each other than they are to measures of cognitive ability. 
These results have been replicated with school-aged children (Kleitman & Gibson, 2011; Kleitman & Moscrop, 2010). 
Stankov (1999) has argued that conﬁdence is a trait that lies on the interface between cognitive ability and personality. 
The utility of conﬁdence ratings to provide important student-level and item-level information (see e.g. 
Stankov, Lee & Paek, 2009; Stankov, Lee et al., 2012; Tan, Stankov, Luo, & Hogan, submitted for publication) for Rasch analyses based on conﬁdence judgments, suggests that much can be learned by using this simple technique. 
4.3. 
Conﬁdence as self-monitoring The unexpectedly poor mathematics performance of the Finnish students offered us an opportunity to explore another important feature of conﬁdence: self-monitoring. 
Looking at Figs. 
8 and 9 it is clear that Finland is more like Serbia and Latvia on accuracy, yet more like The Netherlands and Denmark on bias. 
Based on previous PISA results we would expect the mathematics performance of Finnish students to be more like Confucians’ or The Netherlands and Denmark. 
We speculate that (normally high-achieving) Finnish students knew that they were performing poorly. 
The same did not happen to Serbs and Latvians who, on this interpretation, were less aware than those from high-scoring countries about how much they know and do not know. 
At an individual level, bias scores could offer useful feedback to students about how well they can monitor their performance – this may assist students to plan their study and revision more effectively. 
It may be useful to re-iterate that, at the country level, our results show that there are virtually no differences in conﬁdence (see Table 4 and Fig. 7), especially if we remove Finland from consideration. 
The main differences are in attainment (see Fig. 8) and these are due to the low performing Serbian and Latvian/Russian students, not to better performing Europeans (Dutch and Danes). 
Country-level differences in bias scores (see Fig. 9) that reﬂect the correlation between accuracy and conﬁdence are due entirely to differences in attainment (i.e., accuracy scores). 
Thus, one interpretation of our ﬁndings is that countries differ in terms of attainment while the differences in conﬁdence are not pronounced. 
This general ﬁnding may point to a survival value of conﬁdence in our contemporary societies – it may cushion low achieving countries (and individuals) from experiencing too much stress. 
This ﬁnding also speaks against the claim that our results may be a methodological artifact due to the possibility that increased conﬁdence may be related to mathematical ability at the country level. 
Thus, although Confucian countries score high on mathematics items, their conﬁdence is the same as most European countries. 
4.4. 
Is there an optimum level of (over)conﬁdence? 
In a discussion of differences between Confucians and Europeans, Stankov (2010) suggested that culture might be a reason for higher anxiety and self-doubt among Confucian Asian students. 
One of the implications of self-doubt and anxiety is caution and hesitancy to take chances. 
This is important in a knowledge economy, since those who exhibit caution and wait for others to lead may be left behind. 
Risk-taking and entrepreneurship by deﬁnition require some level of overconﬁdence in one’s own abilities, because if people were wholly realistic about the objective probability of success, many would never take the chance. 
Accordingly then, it may be worrisome that students in Singapore and Hong Kong have very low levels of overconﬁdence – around 5 or 6% – in comparison to their high-performing European counterparts at around 10%. 
Two other studies with Singaporean students involving both mathematics and English tests resulted in a similar level of bias to this study (Stankov, Lee, et al., 2012; Stankov et al., in press; Stankov, Pallier, et al., 2012). 
It is too early at this stage to read too much into these differences, but further studies may elucidate whether there is an optimum level of overconﬁdence. 
Related to the above, boys in our study have average overconﬁdence of 18% and girls 9%; it is known that young men in industrialized countries and those of lower ability in particular are at highest risk of an early death because they are risktakers (O’Toole & Stankov, 1992). 
What is not known is how generalized the overconﬁdence of young men is, how problematic it is, and whether attempts to reduce their overconﬁdence might have adverse effects. 
Given the evidence for conﬁdence as a general trait, this may be a fruitful avenue for further research. 
In particular, longitudinal developmental studies may reveal much about the inﬂuence of sex hormones on the development of conﬁdence. 
An alternative view is simply to accept that there may be cultural and gender differences in overconﬁdence, and that both overconﬁdent (risk-takers) and well-calibrated (cautious) or underconﬁdent individuals have important roles to play. 
While too much caution can result in missed opportunities and risk-taking may result in higher rewards, risk-taking carries higher costs; in this sense it should not be assumed that one is necessarily better than the other. 
What does seem to be problematic is high conﬁdence combined with low accuracy.

Future directions One important step toward furthering these important ﬁndings is to incorporate post-item conﬁdence measures and post-test evaluation measures into the well-funded and comprehensively sampled international studies such as PISA and TIMSS. 
We have every reason to believe that the pattern of results according to region and gender identiﬁed in this study will be replicated using a larger and broader selection of mathematics items. 
The measurement of post-item conﬁdence offers promise in education as a tool for researchers, teachers, and students. 
This is particularly the case now that computerized test-taking is a possibility for more and more students so feedback can be immediate and analysis of conﬁdence ratings automatised. 
Recent work by Kleitman with university students has shown that incorporating regular conﬁdence measures into learning may help students to manage and regulate their own learning (Kleitman & Costa, in press). 
Further research with school students will help illuminate the extent to which calibration both reﬂects and enhances learning.
