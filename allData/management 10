INTRODUCTION For many people, leisure, recreation and vacation activities are related, and therefore travelling even long distances to participate in a preferred activity is not unusual (Chang & Gibson, 2011). 
For example, Bryan (1977) observes that, as anglers become more specialized, they tend to use their vacations to travel to other destinations to further practice and develop their angling skills. 
Hunters likewise seem to travel considerable distances to participate in a wished-for hunting experience. 
For example, in 2009, 62% of overseas clients who visited South Africa came from Northern America, 17% from Europe, and 18% from Scandinavia (Carroll, 2010). 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 South Africa also attracts hunters from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Croatia, Vietnam, and the United Arab Emirates. 
European hunters, particularly those from Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Denmark, and the Benelux countries, are avid travellers. 
Popular destinations are Hungary, Poland, other Eastern European countries, and Scandinavia (Brainerd, 2007). 
In follows that providers of the South African hunting safari have to compete with a variety of countries for the patronage of hunters from abroad. 
South African safari hunting (also known as sport hunting or trophy hunting) refers to legitimate and organized hunting activities undertaken by individuals, mostly from abroad, whose primary objective is securing trophies from killed animals, birds, and reptiles (Report to the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, 2005). 
Trophies are often presented as skull mounts, shoulder mounts, full mounts, tusk mounts, and/or rugs. 
An understanding of individuals’ motivations (in this instance, those of hunters) is important (O’Connell, 2010; Oh, Uysal & Weaver, 1995; Kruger & Saayman, 2010) for a number of reasons. 
Firstly, motivation is a fundamental force behind all human behavior as it arouses, directs, and integrates behaviour (Crompton, 1979; Iso-Ahola, 1982; Fodness, 1994). 
Because motivation is both an impelling and a compelling force behind all behavior (Crompton, 1979; Fodness, 1994) it serves as an initial point in studying tourist and travel behavior (Devesa, Laguna, & Palacois, 2010). 
Secondly, motivation drives individuals’ choice and could therefore help explain their preference for participating in certain leisure activities and their choice of destination for this purpose (Moscardo, Morrison, Pearce, Lang & O’Leary, 1996). 
It seems reasonable to argue that an understanding of hunters’ motivations could also be the starting point in understanding why they participate in this activity and why they travel to South Africa for this purpose. 
Thirdly, individuals have different needs, and hence a misunderstanding of their intrinsic motivations could hamper the design of appropriate offerings and experiences (Beh & Bruyere, 2007; Crompton & McKay 1997). 
The provision of less than optimum offerings will impede need fulfillment and consequent customer satisfaction and loyalty (Yoon & Uysal, 2005). 
The latter typically leads to re-visits and the spreading of positive word-of-mouth communication about the experience (Anderson, 1998; Huo & Miller, 2007). 
This in turn contributes to the organization’s long-term economic success (Akama & Kieti, 2003). 
Lastly, organizational success is enhanced by effective marketing activities such as segmentation, product and image development, and better-focused promotional activities (Fodness, 1994; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). 
Identifying and prioritizing hunters’ motivations are therefore likely to facilitate the effectiveness of other marketing activities (Crompton & McKay, 1997). 
Authors such as Oh et al. (1995) point out that in addition to understanding the impelling (“push”) and compelling (“pull”) factors of motivation, it is also important to understand the relationship between these motivations. 
Such knowledge can help destination marketers determine the most successful coupling of motivational factors into tourism bundles (Goodrich, 1977). 
Similarly, knowledge about hunters’ desires for hunting and for choosing South Africa for this activity, may indicate destination attributes that would best satisfy their needs. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 In addition to explaining the interrelationship between motivations, a number of studies have also hypothesized that motivations to participate in an activity may differ because of sociodemographic variables. 
For example, O’Connell (2010) has found differences in motivation to sea kayak based on age, gender and level of experience. 
Nationality also seems to impact motivations. 
It can be used for understanding tourists’ push factors and preferences in terms of destination attributes (Prayag & Ryan, 2011) and to explain differences in motivation to travel to South Korea, for instance, the length of pre-travel planning, information sources used, and length of stay (Kim & Prideaux, 2005). 
Although hunters’ motivations have been fairly well researched, they have hardly been investigated in the context of the South African hunting safari. 
This is surprising given the important contribution safari hunting makes to the economy of the country. 
For example, in 2009, R607million (US$85million) resulted from daily rates and species fees only; in 2008, the corresponding figure was R973million (US$136million) (Carroll, 2010). 
This amount excludes taxidermy work, tips, and indirect contributions to other parts of the economy, such as airlines, pre-and post-safari accommodation, and shopping. 
The present study had four objectives, namely to: (1) examine non-resident hunters’ motivations for participating in hunting; (2) explore their motivations for choosing South Africa as a hunting destination; (3) determine the interrelationship between these motivations; and (4) determine whether motivations differ because of non-motivational factors such as sociodemographics. 
In order to place the study into context, the next section provides a brief description of the South African hunting safari. 
The subsequent review of motivation establishes a conceptual basis for the formulation of the aforementioned research objectives. 
The remainder of the paper explains the methods applied in collecting and analyzing the primary data, presents and discusses the results, and provides conclusions and managerial implications. 
Finally, the limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are presented. 
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE The South African Hunting Safari Although hunting can be viewed as a food resource, a way of life, or the primary tool for wildlife management agencies to control game populations (Brown et al., 2000 cited by Lindberg, 2010), the South African hunting safari is a typical, wildlife-related, nature-based, outdoor leisure activity. 
Even though the hunting safari occurs mainly on privately owned game ranches (Von Brandis & Reilly, 2007), it is regulated by a well-organized game ranching and professional hunting industry (PHASA, 2009). 
A hunting outfitter typically provides all the services required by the visiting hunter. 
These include the arrangement of the hunt, obtaining the necessary Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 hunting permits, dealing with landowners, and seeing to written agreements regarding trophy fees, daily rates, and the species and sex of game offered (PHASA, 2009). 
Other services relate to ground transportation, accommodation, domestic air charters, actual hunting, and preparation, packaging, and shipping of trophies (Booth, 2009). 
The outfitter is assisted by trained Professional Hunters (individuals who have attended a registered Professional hunting school, passed the theoretical and practical examinations set by the relevant Provincial Nature Conservation Authorities, and possess the specified knowledge, abilities, skills and experience. 
The latter includes at least sixty days experience hunting dangerous game). 
Hunters can choose a package from a selection of safaris. 
The final cost of the safari is negotiated and depends on the availability of the hunting area, dates and species, the status of the booking sheet, and the reputation of the outfitter and/or professional hunter. 
These negotiations can take up to 18 months, with the typical big-game hunter paying over US$100,000 for a 21-day hunting experience (Booth, 2009). 
This figure excludes costs for additional guests, such as observers or family members, who accompany the hunter. 
Motivation Various theories have been put forward to explain motivation, an often-researched topic in psychology, sociology, consumer behaviour, and tourism (Hung & Petrick, 2010). 
Crompton and McKay (1997) note three alternative taxonomic frameworks which delineate and order individual motives into categories and serve as the basis for most research. 
These are Maslow’s needs hierarchy, Iso-Ahola’s escape-seeking dichotomy, and the notion of “push-pull” factors. 
Maslow (1970) classifies needs hierarchically, with physiological needs at the most basic level, self-actualization at the other extreme, and safety, social and esteem needs in-between. 
This needs classification has found application in the Leisure Motivation Scale which differentiates between four categories of motives: (1) motives with a mental and intellectual component, comprising elements such as learning, exploring, discovering, thinking, or imagining; (2) those with a social component, describing the needs for friendship, interpersonal relationships, and esteem of others; (3) a physical competency-challenge component, represented by a need to achieve, master, challenge, and compete; and (4) a stimulus-avoidance component, reflected in the desire to avoid social contact and seek solitude, calm, and rest (Ragheb & Beard 1982; Ryan 1995). 
Iso-Ahola’s (1982) theory of motivation has also found application in leisure, recreation and tourism contexts (Snepenger, King, Marshall & Uysal, 2006). 
This theory holds that motivation comprises two principal components, escaping from routine environments, and seeking intrinsic rewards (Iso-Ahola, 1982). 
The escape-seeking dichotomy contributes to the “push-pull” framework (Dann, 1977), which provides a useful approach for examining the motivations underlying tourist and visitation behavior (Kim, Lee & Klenosky, 2003). 
In this framework, “push” or impelling factors (Baloglu Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 & Uysal 1996) are primarily related to internal or emotional aspects, such as the desire for escape, rest and relaxation, adventure or social interaction. 
“Push” factors are reinforced by “pull” factors (Shen, 2009) which describe the external, situational or cognitive aspects associated with the destination itself (Devesa, Laguna & Palacois, 2010). 
Typical “pull” factors are the features, attractions and attributes of the destination (Kim, et al., 2003), such as leisure infrastructure, cultural or natural features (Devesa et al., 2010), key tourist resources, information, convenience, accessibility and transportation (Kim et al., 2003). 
Two important sets of motivations can be identified from the preceding discussion. 
The first set refers to psychographic, emotional motivations that largely influence the choice of activity, and which for the purposes of this research, are referred to as activity-related factors. 
The second set of motivations includes external, situational or cognitive motivations that impact on decisions about where such an activity should be undertaken. 
In this study, these motivations are referred to as destination-related. 
The activity-related motivations of hunters have been fairly well documented. 
Bauer and Herr (2004) suggest that for some people, hunting is an immersion in a basic activity which, from an evolutionary perspective, provides in individuals’ primary nutritional needs. 
While the modern consumer generally no longer depends on hunting for his survival, “the ability to provide a meal from wildlife [still] reflects on a person’s status within a family … [something] that … feels good” (Bauer & Herr, 2004: 62). 
Other motivations for participation in hunting include being in nature, the dream of self-sufficiency (even if for only a few days), the desire for adventure or for honing childhood skills, or simply having a good time with friends and family (Bauer & Herr, 2004; Frawley, 2005; Moscardo et al., 1996). 
Commonalities in hunting motivations are found across environments and species. 
For example, research conducted in North America (Hendee, 1974; Decker et al., 1984; Decker & Connelly, 1989), Europe (Pinet, 1995), and South Africa (Radder & Bech-Larsen, 2008) suggests that hunters are motivated by the wish to achieve, be affiliated with others, and appreciating the environment. 
Affiliation-motivated hunters desire camaraderie (Pinet, 1995) and strengthening of personal relationships with hunting partners (Decker, et al., 1984). 
Achievement-motivated individuals hunt to meet a self-determined standard of performance, while appreciation-motivated hunters have a love for nature (Pinet, 1995) and hunt to relax and to escape from everyday concerns (Decker et al., 1984). 
South African domestic hunters showed similar motivations which, when analyzed on a more abstract level in a means-end study, transposed into personal values of achievement, hedonism, stimulation, universalism, and conformity (Radder & Bech-Larsen, 2008). 
Motivations seem to be fairly similar irrespective of the species hunted. 
Hunters of mourning doves in Alabama are motivated by companionship, nature, exercise, challenge, tradition, escape, and learning (Hayslette, Armstrong & Mirarchi, 2001). 
Small-game hunters in Michigan cite recreation, being with friends and family, managing wildlife, feeling close to nature, relaxation, and small game being a source of food, as their reasons for hunting (Frawley, Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 2005). 
Big-game hunters enjoy the experience, adventure, potential danger and acquisition of the trophy (Bauer & Herr, 2004). 
The lack of research into the activity-related motivations of safari hunters and the importance of understanding the interrelationship between activity-related and destinationrelated motivations (as explained earlier on), led to the first objective of the present study, namely to explore the activity-related motivations for participating in a hunting safari. 
In comparison to the research attention given to hunters’ motivations for participating in hunting, their motivations for travelling to another country for this purpose, have not been well documented. 
Bauer and Herr (2004) have suggested that hunters might travel internationally because supply in their home countries does not meet demand, and/or because destination countries offer cheaper, more diverse or more exciting hunting experiences. 
Brainerd (2007) is of the opinion that hunters who travel to more exotic and unfamiliar destinations may place greater emphasis on adventure and souvenirs (e.g. trophies) than is the case when they are wellacquainted with their destination and familiar with the species they hunt. 
South Africa is arguably such a sought-after hunting destination, given its wide variety of habitats and landscapes which result in an unusual selection of birds, reptiles, ungulates, and huntable mammals. 
These include the Big Five (lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and rhinoceros) which are regarded as the five most dangerous and most difficult animals to hunt on foot in Africa. 
South Africa and Namibia are also arguably the only countries where both black (Diceros bicornis) and white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) can be hunted as trophies. 
Up to now, research into the South African hunting safari has focused on perceived risks and rewards (Radder & Han, 2008) and hunters’ expectations and satisfaction (Radder & Han, 2010), without paying any attention to destination-related motivations. 
The second objective of this research was therefore to determine why hunters travel to South Africa for a hunting safari. 
A number of authors (e.g. 
Dann, 1981; Klenosky, 2002) hold that the so-called “push and pull” factors of motivation are two separate decisions made at different points in time. 
However, others (e.g. 
Baloglu & Uysal, 1996; Kim et al., 2003) point out that these factors are fundamentally related to each other. 
In fact, Baloglu and Uysal (1996) argue that knowledge about this interrelationship can help marketers and developers of destination areas create the most successful combination of motivations as tourism product bundles. 
Given the highly competitive environment of the international hunting industry, and the scarcity of research into the South African hunting safari, it was deemed important to investigate the existence of a relationship between hunters’ motivations. 
This constituted the third objective of the current study. 
The impact of socio-demographics on individuals’ motivations has been investigated in different contexts (e.g. 
Kim & Prideaux, 2005; O’Connell, 2010; Prayag & Ryan, 2011). 
For example, in a hunting context, it was found that the age of the hunter did not change the relative importance of the reasons for involvement in small-game hunting (Frawley, 2005). 
Similarly, age, current place of residence, and prior experience, had no significant impact on declining Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 hunter participation after controlling for personal and situational constraints (Miller & Vaske, 2003). 
On the other hand, Decker and Connelly (1989) found that achievement-oriented deer hunters tended to be younger and had fewer years of hunting experience than other hunters, while hunters seeking affiliation, tended to be older than others. 
Given that differences in motivations for different socio-demographics can impact visitor satisfaction (Kim et al., 2003), the fourth objective of the present study was to determine whether safari hunters’ motivations differ because of socio-demographic factors. 
METHODS Data Collection And Measurement Three sections of a structured questionnaire designed to solicit data on aspects of the South African hunting safari were pertinent to the current study and are reported here. 
One section obtained socio-demographic data, while the other two dealt with activity-related and destination-related motivations respectively. 
An initial pool of statements embodying motivational items was refined into a 29-item list of activity-related motivations and a 13-item list of destination-related motivations. 
The respondents were asked to use a 6-point forced-choice Likert scale to rate their level of agreement (1 = strongly disagree and 6 = strongly agree) with each of the statements. 
Because of confidentiality reasons, the researchers were not allowed access to hunters’ contact details, and the assistance of an official facilitator in the industry was enlisted. 
His office distributed survey packages (each comprising a questionnaire and a postage-paid reply envelope) to 2 000 conveniently selected potential respondents who had participated in a South African hunting safari in recent years. 
By the due date, 236 useable questionnaires were returned. 
This yielded a tolerable overall response rate of 13.2% (Dillon, Madden & Firtle, 1994). 
However, only 191 respondents answered all the questions relevant to the section dealing with motivations, and the results reported here pertain to these respondents only. 
Statistical Analysis Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) helped identify the latent dimensions of hunters’ motivations, using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) at the extraction stage, and the OBLIMIN technique at the rotation stage. 
The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (0.817 and 0.781 respectively) and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p<0.001) indicated that both sets of scores were suitable for factor analysis (Sekaran, 2000; Hair, Black, Babin & Anderson, 2010). 
The number of factors was determined according to Kaiser’s rule (Kaiser, 1960). 
The results indicated that six factors in the activity-related motivation data, and three factors in the Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 destination-related motivation data, had eigenvalues greater than one. 
Six items were deleted because of their unsatisfactory factor loadings. 
Only three of the remaining items had loadings below 0.4, but they were retained given the exploratory nature of the study. 
An inspection of the components correlation matrix showed that the resulting factors could be clearly distinguished. 
Internal consistency was regarded as adequate (Sekaran, 2000; Hair et al., 2010) because the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.64 to 0.82 in the case of the six activity-related factors and from 0.62 and 0.87 in the case of the three destination-related factors. 
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the existence of interrelationships between the motivational factors. 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), was performed to determine whether activity-related and destination-related motivations differed by socio-demographic variables. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Profile Of Respondents Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the respondents. 
More than three quarters of the respondents came from the USA. 
Those classified as non-USA were from countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Ireland, Croatia, and Mexico. 
This distribution corresponds to the overall trends indicated by Carroll (2010), namely that the largest proportion of safari hunters who visit South Africa, come from the USA. 
The majority of respondents were males, between 40 and 60 years of age. 
About equal numbers of respondents had a rural and urban childhood, while slightly more resided in rural areas at the time of the survey. 
Only about 13% of the respondents had no post-school qualification, compared to the 36% with more than five years post-school education. 
Of those who answered the question, 41% had an annual gross household income of less than US$100,000, while 27% earned more than US$200,000. 
Almost half (47.1%) of the respondents regarded themselves as experienced hunters (Level 4). This seems to confirm the supposition of Bryan (1977) that as individuals become more experienced in their leisure activity, they tend to travel to unfamiliar destinations to further practice and develop their skills.

It is significant that the respondents felt most strongly about the contribution their hunting makes to wildlife conservation (M=5.54). 
It has been proven in South Africa that the bontebok, black wildebeest, Cape mountain zebra, geometric tortoises and numerous rare plant species were saved from extinction because of the actions of the country’s hunting industry and private game ranch owners (Hamman, Lloyd & Stadler, 2005). 
In addition to saving these species, hunting also contributes to preventing and reducing the costly impacts caused by the overpopulation of certain species (Mauser & Paddon, 2000) particularly in the absence of other predators, as happened with the elephant in certain conservation areas in South Africa. 
Factor 2, Ego enhancement, gathered items with an outer-focus on the self, while Factor 4, Self-awareness, has an inner focus on the self. 
It is interesting that Factor 2 had a higher factor mean score than Factor 4. A comparison of the item mean scores forming part of Ego enhancement seems to indicate that while hunters enjoyed others’ admiration of their trophies, they were less likely to equate securing trophies with hunting success. 
They also did not seem to view hunting as a way to reinforce their male identity or to satisfy a need to be in control. 
Factor 3 (Caring for family), had a low factor mean score of 3.27 which may confirm the purpose of the hunting safari as securing a trophy, rather than obtaining meat. 
Factor 5 (Excitement/challenge) grouped together items that describe the excitement and uniqueness of each hunt and the challenge involved in outwitting the animal. It is interesting that Excitement/Challenge had a much higher mean score (M=5.11) than that of Ego enhancement (M=3.77) or Self-awareness (M=3.15). 
This probably indicates that respondents’ motivations to Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 meet a self-determined standard of performance were more strongly associated with competing against the animal, than competing with other hunters. 
The items describing Factor 6 (Social interaction/mental stimulation) relate to the camaraderie brought about by hunting and opportunities for mental stimulation. 
It seems that although hunters participated in hunting for the opportunity of associating with others who had similar interests (M=4.93, Item 10), sharing this experience with family (M=5.05, Item 06), was a stronger motivation. 
Upon further examination of the six activity-related motivational factors, it was found that they could be regrouped into three categories: (1), appreciation-oriented motivations, described by Personal values; (2) affiliation-oriented motivations, described by Caring for family and Social interaction/mental stimulation, and (3), achievement-oriented motivations comprising Ego enhancement, Self-awareness and Excitement/challenge. 
An inspection of the mean scores of the three sets of activity-related motivations shows that the respondents participate in safari hunting, firstly because of appreciation motivations (M=5.35). 
This is followed by affiliation motivations (M=4.10), while achievement motivations were least important (M=4.01). Factor Analysis of Destination-Related Motivation The destination-related motivation items yielded three factors which were labeled Attributes and features, Novelty, and External stimuli (see Table 3). The high mean scores of Novelty (M=5.03) and of Attributes and features (M=5.03) indicate that these factors make South Africa a desired hunting destination. 
Of particular importance were the abundance of game (M=5.41, Item 01) and the natural beauty of the country (M=5.31, Item 03). 
The results furthermore indicate that hunting in South Africa is viewed as a novelty (unique experience and a dream come true). 
External stimuli such as recommendations by other hunters and promotional material, in particular, were of lesser importance. 
Table 3: Results of Factor Analysis for Destination-Related Motivations Item Nr Factors and Items Mean SD Factor 1: Attributes and features (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.76) 5.03 0.72 01 South Africa has an abundance of game 5.41 0.82 03 The country has exceptional natural beauty 5.31 0.80 09 The country offers a wide variety of hunting habitats and therefore many different hunting regions 5.13 0.97 07 The country has the best variety of species to hunt 4.75 1.07 08 South Africa offers many cultural attractions apart from hunting 4.55 1.31 Factor 2: Novelty (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.87) 5.03 0.72 11 Hunting in South Africa is a truly unique experience 5.04 1.11 12 Hunting in South Africa is a dream come true 5.03 1.15 Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Table 3: Results of Factor Analysis for Destination-Related Motivations Item Nr Factors and Items Mean SD Factor 3: External stimuli (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.62) 3.88 1.23 06 Recommendations by other hunters persuaded me to hunt in South Africa 4.60 1.31 04 Brochures and other marketing material persuaded me to hunt in South Africa 3.55 1.58 05 Exhibitions at a convention persuaded me to hunt in South Africa 3.48 1.75 Relationship between Activity-Related and Destination-Related Motivations The third objective of the research was to determine the interrelationships between motivations. 
The results from Pearson’s correlation analyses, reported in Table 4, indicate that the destination-related factor termed Attributes and features, had significant positive correlations with four activity-related motivational factors (p<0.05). 
While the correlations with Personal values (0.23) and Caring for family (0.15) were fairly weak, those for Excitement/challenge (0.31) and Social interaction/mental stimulation (0.39) were moderate. 
This suggests that the natural beauty and diversity typical of the South African hunting environment provides visiting hunters with the desired excitement and challenge of matching their skills against those of the animal. It also provides hunters with the opportunity to meet new people and learn from them. 
Table 4: The Relationship Between Activity-Related and Destination-Related Motivations Destination-related Activity-related Attributes and features Novelty External stimuli Personal values 0.23* 0.13 0.06 Ego enhancement 0.14 0.15* 0.37* Caring for family 0.15* 0.08 0.07 Self-awareness 0.12 0.07 0.13 Excitement/challenge 0.31* 0.29* 0.16* Social interaction/mental stimulation 0.39* 0.31* 0.25* Note:*p<0.05 Novelty, the second destination-related motivational factor, was significantly correlated, albeit weakly, with Ego enhancement (0.15) and Excitement/challenge (0.29), and moderately correlated with Social interaction/mental stimulation (0.31). 
It suggests that the South African hunting safari provides hunters with the opportunity to share their dreams and experiences with others, and to learn something new. 
External stimuli, the third factor in the destination-related motivation category, indicated a moderate correlation with Ego enhancement (0.37), but a weaker correlation with Social interaction/mental stimulation (0.25) and Excitement/challenge (0.16). 
Given the fairly high mean score for Recommendations from other hunters (M=4.60) compared to the non-personal sources of promotional communication (Table 3), the stronger correlation between External stimuli and Ego enhancement is understandable. 
It can be readily assumed that hunters would Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 like to show off their hunting skills and trophies to other hunters in particular, rather than just to anyone. 
The Impact of Socio-Demographic Characteristics The fourth objective was to determine how the activity- and destination-related motivations differed based on hunters’ personal characteristics such as age, income, level of education, childhood and current home environments, country of residence and level of hunting experience (See Table 1). Gender was excluded from this analysis because of the small number of females who responded. 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Tukey post-hoc tests indicated that none of the activity-related motivations differed by childhood home environment, age, income, or level of education. 
Significant differences were, however, found for current home environment, country of residence, and level of hunting experience. 
Table 5 indicates that respondents who lived in a rural environment felt more strongly about hunting as a way of caring for family, than urbanites did. 
Personal values played a more important role as an activity-related motivator in the case of USA hunters compared to their nonUSA counterparts. 
Similar results were found for Ego enhancement, Excitement/challenge and Social interaction/mental stimulation. 
Level of hunting experience served as a differentiator for Personal values and for Excitement/challenge. 
The Wilks post-hoc test (λ=0.000) indicated that differences existed particularly between the role of personal values for least experienced hunters (M=4.73, Level 1) and most experienced hunters (M=5.51, Level 4). Level of experience caused a difference in Excitement/challenge between hunters with a Level 2 and a Level 4 hunting experience (λ=0.042). 
In both cases, a higher mean score was obtained for the Level 4 (most experienced) hunters. 
Age, childhood environment, home environment, and level of education did not show any significant differences in the mean scores of the destination-related factors of motivation. 
Statistically significant differences were, however, indicated for annual household income, country of residence, and level of hunting experience (Table 6). The Tukey post-hoc test indicated significant differences (p<0.05) between hunters with an annual household income of US$100 000 or less and those earning more than US$200 000 (λ=0.023). 
Novelty had a higher mean score (M=5.13) for hunters residing in the USA than those who reside outside of the USA (M=4.72) and showed a significant difference between the two groups. 
Novelty also differed significantly between hunters with a Level 2 hunting experience and those with a Level 4 experience (λ=0.029). 
An inspection of the mean scores listed in Table 6 indicates that hunters with a Level 4 hunting experience had a much lower mean score (M=4.88) for novelty than the Level 2 hunters (M=5.47).

This research attempted to contribute to the body of knowledge on the motivations of safari hunters in four ways: (1) by exploring the reasons why individuals from abroad who have hunted in South Africa, engage in hunting; (2) by exploring their motivations for traveling to South Africa for this purpose; (3) by examining the relationship between these two sets of motivations; and (4) by examining the relationship between hunters’ motivations and their socio-demographic characteristics. 
Given the competitiveness of the international hunting industry, the results may assist providers of the South African hunting safari to better match hunters’ desires, enhance satisfaction and guide marketing strategies such as promotion. 
In relation to participation in hunting, the results indicated that “activity-related motivations”, is a multi-dimensional phenomenon comprising six motivational factors: Personal values, Ego enhancement, Caring for family, Self-awareness, Excitement/challenge and Social interaction/mental stimulation. 
These factors can be categorized into appreciation-oriented motivations, affiliation-oriented motivations, and achievement-oriented motivations. 
These categories are thematically similar to those reported in previous research (e.g. 
Decker et al., 1984; Decker & Connelly, 1989; Hendee, 1974; Pinet, 1995). 
Appreciation-oriented motivations included the wish to contribute to traditional values, conservation, learning, family togetherness and escape. 
These motivations correspond to those suggested by Decker and Connelly (1989: 457), namely “seeking a sense of peace, belonging and familiarity and the resulting stress reduction that they [hunters] have come to associate with the activity”, and with those indicated by Frawley (2005), namely managing wildlife, being close to nature, relaxation, and being with family and friends. 
Affiliation-oriented motivations, the second category of activity-related motivations, focused on the family and interaction with other hunters. 
These items correspond to the affiliation motivations described by Decker and Connelly (1989). 
Respondents’ achievement-related motivations were embedded in excitement, challenge, ego enhancement and self-awareness. 
Excitement and challenge described the uniqueness of each hunt and the challenge involved in outwitting the animal. The latter corresponds to the achievement-oriented motivation found by Pinet (1995), namely meeting a self-determined standard of performance. 
Overall, the hunters who have participated in the current research were motived to hunt, primarily by appreciation-related reasons, and to a lesser degree, by affiliation-oriented- and achievement-oriented reasons. 
This pattern is in line with that found among hunters elsewhere in the world (Decker & Connelly, 1989; Pinet, 2005). 
Marketers of the South African hunting Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 safari can therefore assume, albeit with caution, that these trends are common among most hunters. 
Hunting experiences that provide visiting hunters with the best opportunity to satisfy their appreciation-oriented motivations are therefore likely to have a competitive advantage over those that focus on satisfying achievement-oriented motivations. 
In relation to destination-related or pull factors associated with South Africa, the results again highlighted the multi-dimensionality of motivations. 
The factor analysis resulted in three factors: Attributes and features, Novelty, and External stimuli. 
These results confirm those of Bauer and Herr (2004) that hunters travel to other countries because the latter offer more diverse or exciting hunting experiences. 
It is important from a marketers’ perspective that external stimuli such as brochures and exhibitions, generally played a lesser role in pulling hunters to South Africa than did the attributes, features and novelty associated with the destination. 
Consistent with other research (e.g. 
Oh et al., 1995), this research also found a relationship between motivations. 
For example, the results indicated that South Africa’s nature and diversity and the novelty of the destination, offer hunters the excitement and challenges they desire, and the opportunity of meeting new people and learning from them. 
This has two important managerial implications. 
First, the natural environment and the diversity it offers must be maintained. 
South Africa’s nature is regarded as the third most diverse in the world (Patterson & Khosa, 2005). 
The wide variety of habitats supports a selection of huntable species which includes the Big Five. 
If the country loses this diversity and uniqueness, it may also lose some of its competitive advantage over non-African countries, particularly given the long distances hunters have to travel to reach South Africa. 
Secondly, the findings may be used in promotional material, to encourage hunters to visit South Africa to experience its unique natural features and satisfy their appreciative desires. 
Previous research into the effect of socio-demographics on motivations had mixed results. 
For example, Decker and Connelly (1989) found that achievement-oriented hunters tended to be younger and had fewer years of hunting experiences than other hunters, while affiliation-oriented hunters are older. 
Most of the appreciation-oriented hunters were in their middle years and had between 11 and 30 years of experience. 
In contrast with these findings, the results of the current study indicate that age did not have a significant effect on hunters’ motivations. 
Neither did level of post-school education or childhood environment. 
Significant differences were, however found between home environment, country of residence, and hunting experience in activity-related motivations. 
Significant differences were also found between income, hunting experience, country of residence, and destination-related motivations. 
The latter finding supports those of previous studies (e.g. 
O’Connell, 2010, Prayag & Ryan, 2011) which indicated a relationship between nationality and motivations. 
The differences between the groups of hunters may assist marketers in identifying appropriate segments among their clients. 
Segmentation is a method of categorizing people on the basis of unique as well as shared characteristics. 
This tool can help marketers design offerings that address the major motivations of a particular segment, and in doing so, greatly enhance the efficacy of their strategies. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH There are a number of limitations to this study. 
First, the data were collected using a convenience sampling framework. 
This might have limited the representativeness of the sample. 
In addition, the response rate was fairly low, which could have resulted in some non-response bias. 
Second, three-quarters of the respondents were resident in the USA. 
While this proportion is more or less in accordance with the proportions of resident countries of hunters who typically visit South Africa, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Future researchers may wish to seek out hunters from countries other than the USA to gain a better understanding of their motivations and to allow for generalization. 
Finally, level of experience in this study was operationalized as a 6-point semantic scale, having “novice” and “expert”, as end-points. 
These categories were later on transposed into a 4point scale. 
Given the subjectivity of this measure, future research could expand on how level of experience is measured. 
This may provide a clearer distinction of motivations between hunters with differing levels of experience.
