1. Introduction Life history data on 50+ Europeans reveal that quite often the ﬁrst form of ﬁnancial investment is a life insurance policy. 
This pattern was ﬁrst highlighted in Cavapozzi, Fiume, Garrouste and Weber (2011), who also showed that the median age of entry into ﬁnancial markets is heavily affected by the development of the life insurance industry. 
Very few life insurance policies are pure insurance instruments that cover the risk of premature death by the policy holder. 
Most, instead, have an important savings component, that increases over time and is paid back irrespective of the death of the policyholder. 
This savings component is invested by the insurance company – but the policy holder is normally guaranteed a minimum return. 
In most countries, life insurance policies can (or could until a few years ago) also act as tax shelters (insurance premiums could be deducted from taxable income up to some limit). 
For these reasons, and also because of aggressive door-todoor marketing strategies, life-insurance policies are often purchased by individuals who are liable to income tax, have little prior knowledge of and conﬁdence in ﬁnancial markets. 
Life insurance policies are associated with high costs and commissions (that partly offset the value of tax exemptions) but turn out to be attractive to certain investors for speciﬁc reasons. 
For instance, they normally are not counted in the estate of a deceased, so they can be used as a device to increase testamentary freedom. 
Also, they cannot be seized by creditors in the case of bankruptcy, and this makes them potentially interesting to the self-employed. 
Pure life insurance policies are relatively common in association with the purchase of bulky items, such as a car or, more frequently, a dwelling, particularly if a loan or mortgage contract is involved. 
These arrangements are aimed at protecting the mortgage repayment against the risk of premature death of mortgagor and might be required by the borrower. 
However, the data we use in this paper reveal that large fractions of young individuals who are not self-employed bought a life insurance policy at a time when they did not purchase their home. 
A R T I C L E I N F O Article history: Received 21 May 2012 Received in revised form 16 October 2012 Accepted 22 October 2012 Keywords: Life insurance Stock market participation Life history data A B S T R A C T In most European countries life insurance has played a key role in household portfolios, to the extent that it has often been the ﬁrst asset ever purchased. 
In this paper we use life history data from a host of European countries to investigate the role of life insurance investment in shaping individuals’ attitudes towards participation in stocks and mutual funds. 
We show that individuals who purchased a life insurance policy are more likely to invest in stocks and mutual funds later. 
On the one hand, these ﬁndings support the notion that life insurance policies play an educational role in ﬁnancial investment. 
On the other hand, they are also consistent with behavioural models where economic agents are ﬁrst concerned with avoiding unacceptable adverse scenarios by purchasing low risk investments, such as life insurance policies, and then invest in riskier assets, such as stocks and mutual funds, to obtain higher economic returns.

The evidence we present in this paper shows that individuals who purchased a life-insurance policy in a host of European countries were more likely to invest at a later stage also in the stock market, directly (stocks and shares) or indirectly (mutual funds), compared to individuals who did not. 
We use data drawn from SHAREL IFE, the third wave of SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe), which collects lifehistory information on respondents who already participated in previous waves. 
SHARELIFE turns out to be a valuable survey for our ana lysis since it conveys unique information about the events occurred during the whole life of respondents with respect to a variety of dimensions, such as relationships, children, health, employment, housing and ﬁnancial investments. 
More speciﬁcally, SHAREL IFE asks respondents whether they have ever invested in stocks, mutual funds, retirement accounts and life insurance policies during their life. 
Those who have invested are asked about the year in which the ﬁrst investment in each type of asset occurred. 
Our ana lys is will focus on the relationship between previous investments in life insurance policies and the participation in stocks and mutual funds at later ages. 
The purchase of life insurance policies may be associated with an increased propensity to invest in stocks and mutual funds later in life if life insurance policies play the role of a ﬁnancial education device, in so far as they are often the ﬁrst form of managed savings an individual is made aware of – either by banks or insurance agents. 
Investments in life insurance policies might then have been the ﬁrst occasion to familiarize with basic concepts related to ﬁnancial investments, such as transaction costs or returns calculation. 
This way, purchasing a life insurance policy enhances the human capital of individuals and lowers the information costs associated with understanding basic ﬁnancial instruments. 
There is a growing body of literature (including Lusardi & Mitchell, 2007; Jappelli & Padula, 2011) stressing the importance of ﬁnancial literacy in shaping household ﬁnancial investment decisions. 
Our paper suggests a novel way in which European households may have gained ﬁnancial literacy over the half century after World War II. Alternative explanations of the pattern highlighted in this paper can be found in behavioural ﬁnance literature. 
For instance, Shefrin and Statman (2000, p. 127) develop a behavioural portfolio theory model that produces a twolayer portfolio: ‘‘the low aspiration layer is designed to avoid poverty while the high aspiration layer is designed for a shot at riches’’. 
In our analysis, the low aspiration layer could be associated to life insurance investment, while the high aspiration would of course be associated to stock market participation. 
A life-cycle model with bounded rationality may also produce similar predictions: for Binswanger (2011) a feasibility goal approach leads to the optimal portfolio strategy of ﬁrst investing in bonds (low risk assets for the worst case scenario), and later in life in stocks (risky assets for the normal case scenario). 
In this context, life-insurance may prove the natural vehicle for worst-case scenario investment. 
Life insurance policies (that normally require investing a given sum over a number of years) and individual retirement accounts share many features. 
First of all, both can be used as a commitment device by individuals who have problems with planning over time (because they exhibit hyperbolic discounting, Laibson, 1997, or temptation preferences, Gul & Pesendorfer, 2004). 
Secondly, they are managed savings instruments where individuals enjoy the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation in exchange for fees. 
And thirdly, they are or were tax-favoured ﬁnancial instruments – typically, tax exemptions once granted to life insurance policies have been shifted over recent years to individual retirement accounts. 
This suggests that we should consider treating them as close substitutes, and repeat the analysis of ﬁrst entry in stocks and mutual funds conditioning on prior investment in either life insurance or individual retirement accounts. 
It is reassuring to ﬁnd out that the key ﬁndings of this paper are robust to broadening the deﬁnition of life-insurance policies to include individual retirement accounts. 
There are several common factors, such as education, health, household composition and lifetime resources, driving both the decision of purchasing a life insurance policy at a given stage of an individual’s life cycle and the composition of her ﬁnancial portfolio in the following years. 
Some of these factors (e.g. education and to some extent lifetime resources) can be considered time-invariant and related to the early life conditions; others might exhibit considerable lifetime variation (e.g. health and household composition). 
In addition, macroeconomic factors such as rates of returns on stocks, extreme business-cycle episodes, the development of ﬁnancial markets and country-level legislation about tax treatment of ﬁnancial assets are expected to be strong determinants of individuals’ propensity to undertake ﬁnancial investments. 
Failing to control for such factors might produce misleading empirical evidence of the relationships of interest. To this end, our econometric speciﬁcations will combine an extensive use of the retrospective individual and household level information in SHARELIFE data with additional country- and time-varying macroeconomic indicators. 
The paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2 we provide a brief description of the data and display prima facie evidence on the importance of life insurance investment for portfolio decisions by European households. 
Section 3 describes our estimation strategy to model the hazard of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds. 
Section 4 explains how the data have been rearranged into a panel to allow estimation of the discrete hazard model. 
Section 5 discusses and interprets estimation results. 
In Section 6 we draw our conclusions. 
2. Prima facie evidence The data set contains information on when (if ever) respondents ﬁrst invested in a life insurance policy, in stocks or mutual funds and in individual retirement accounts. 
It also contains family and work history as well as residential mobility information, so we are for instance able to say when the respondents bought their homes, and whether they did so by taking up a mortgage. 
The data also include information on the parental home (or other place of residence) when the respondent was ten years of age. 
For the most part, our analysis considers ten countries: Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain and Greece. 
We exclude the Czech Republic and Poland because of their late development of ﬁnancial and insurance markets and we exclude France because (whole) life-insurance policies (‘‘assurance vie’’) are included into individual retirement accounts. 
When excluding all three countries, the overall sample consists of about 20,000 individuals. 
Fig. 1 documents the type of ﬁrst ﬁnancial investment purchased by the subsample of individuals who have ever invested in stocks, mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and life insurance policies throughout their life. 
We distinguish four birth-cohort groups: those born in 1934 or earlier (17%), those born between 1935 and 1944 (31%), those born between 1945 and 1949 (21%) and those born in 1950 or later (31%). 
If we look at Nordic countries, Switzerland and Belgium, about 40% of ﬁrst investments are in life insurance policies. 
This percentage increases to more than 60% in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. 
If we focus on Mediterranean countries, ﬁrst investments in life insurance policies are less frequent for the oldest cohorts but they align with other countries when considering more recent cohorts. 
Fig. 2 shows the age distribution of respondents at their ﬁrst investment in stocks or mutual funds. 
Again, we split the sample in the cohort groups considered before, but we pool all countries together. 
Let us consider individuals born in 1934 or earlier. 
When we consider only stocks and mutual funds, the age distribution of ﬁrst investment (upper panel) is bell-shaped and its average is about 56 years of age (the mean corresponds to the vertical bar). 
If we consider the same sample of investors but also include life insurance policies (lower panel), the distribution of the age at ﬁrst investment appears much more left-skewed, and the average decreases to 48 years. 
When life insurance policies are considered, the distribution of age at ﬁrst risky investment is therefore shifted to its left. 
If we look at the other cohort groups, we ﬁnd that, when life insurance investments are considered, the age at ﬁrst ﬁnancial investment always decreases by about 6 years. 
Further, the entry in ﬁnancial markets takes place earlier for more recent cohorts. 
Individuals born in 1950 or later did their ﬁrst investment in stocks or mutual funds when they were 40 years old. 
When life insurance is considered, their ﬁrst investment takes place at 35 years of age. 
The descriptive evidence in Figs. 
1 and 2 is fully consistent with the empirical ﬁndings in Cavapozzi, Fiume, Garrouste, and Weber (2011) and supports the hypothesis that life insurance are often the ﬁrst ﬁnancial investment of the individuals in our sample. 
As a way to establish prima facie evidence on the relationship of interest, we document how the probability Fig. 1. Type of ﬁrst ﬁnancial investment, by cohort. 
of having ever invested in stocks and mutual funds is affected by life insurance policies. 
We split the sample between those who ﬁrst invested in life insurance and those who did not. 
We excluded from this latter group the individuals who ﬁrst invested in stocks and mutual funds since their probability of having ever invested in these assets is equal to 1 by construction. 
Fig. 3 shows that the probability of having ever invested in stocks and mutual funds exhibits wide cross-country variation and is higher for individuals who ﬁrst invested in life insurance policies than for those who never invested in this asset. 
This pattern is found for all countries in our sample and appears to be stronger for Austria and Mediterranean countries. 
In Spain only 11% of those who never invested in life insurance policies have invested in stocks and mutual funds, this percentage rises to 33% for those who ﬁrst invested in life insurance policies. 
Fig. 3 suggests the presence of a positive relationship between previous investments in life insurance and subsequent participation to ﬁnancial markets. 
However, these descriptive statistics do not take into account individual and economy-wide determinants of ﬁnancial behaviour. 
As an example, if individuals who ﬁrst invested in life insurance policies are better educated and better off, they are more likely to invest in other ﬁnancial instruments as well. 
Not controlling for education and lifetime wealth might attribute to previous investment in life insurance policies the role actually played by other relevant factors, whose omission brings about spurious correlation. 
Further, macroeconomic factors, such as returns on stocks and extreme business cycle episodes, or tax treatment of insurance policies, are key facto rs underlying the choice of ﬁrst investing or not in life insurance policies and stock Fig. 2. Age at ﬁrst ﬁnancial investment, by cohort.

market participation. 
Individu als interested in ﬁnancial instruments protecting their wealth from taxes might be more willing to invest in life insurance policies if they are associated with more favourable taxation. 
As long as such tax exemption varies among countries, the evidence in Fig. 3 might then be driven by omitted crosscountry unobserved heterogeneity. 
As anticipated in Section 1, an econometric approach suited to investigate the research question in this paper should control for individual and macroeconomic factors in order to rule out composition effects and overcome the limits of the descriptive evidence presented so far. 
3. Estimation strategy We estimate the hazard rate of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds according to a discrete time duration model. 
Let t be the individual’s age and assume the odd of the individual hazard rate h(tjX t ) to be the product of the odd of the baseline hazard rate h 0 (t), which is common to all individuals and depends on age only, and an exponential function having the product of explanatory variable s X t and a vector of unknown parameters b as argument, hðtjX t Þ 1 À hðtjX t Þ ¼ h 0 ðtÞ 1 À h 0 ðtÞ expðb 0 X t Þ The individual hazard rate depends on X t only through the exponential function exp(b 0 X t ), which acts as a scaling transformation of the odd baseline hazard. 
Note that X t can include time-invariant individual characteristics, individual-speciﬁc time-varying characteristics and economywide time-varying characteristics, too. 
If we take the logarithm of the equation speciﬁed above, we obtain the following log-odd speciﬁcation log hðtjX t Þ 1 À hðtjX t Þ ¼ log h 0 ðtÞ 1 À h 0 ðtÞ þ b 0 X t If log(h 0 (t)/(1 À h 0 (t))) is named a t for convenience, we can rearrange the log-odd speciﬁcation in order to show that the hazard rate can be deﬁned as a logistic function depending on a t , b and X t , hðtjX t Þ ¼ 1 1 þ expðÀa t À b 0 X t Þ We can estimate h(tjX t ) by maximum likelihood logit regressions modelling the decision of investing in stocks and mutual funds at age t conditional on having not invested in these assets before age t. The parameters of interest can be estimated on the basis of a longitudinal sample following individuals up to a given year of age, if they reach this age without having ever invested in stocks and mutual funds (censored information), or until the age in which they ﬁrst invest in these assets, if this age is lower (uncensored information). 
We model a t , which summarizes the duration dependence in the hazard rate, according to a second order polynomial in individual’s age. 
4. Data and estimation variables To estimate the hazard of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds we rearrange SHARELIFE data in order to construct a longitudinal dataset. 
Each respondent contributes as many observations as there are years of age from 18 to 75, or to the age when he/she ﬁrst invests in stocks and mutual funds, if this is lower than 75. The estimation sample contains about 750,000 person-year observations. 
This dataset structure makes it possible to include as explanatory variables a rich set of time-varying indicators describing individuals’ condition at each year of age. 
For each respondent we reconstructed the lifetime variation in life insurance investments, household size, marital status, health, employment condition, type of accommodation and having mortgages or loans on the accommodation. 
We link individual data to macro variables, namely recession or high inﬂation (over 20% on an annual basis). 
Such timevarying indicators are deﬁned at the country level and capture business-cycle effects on individual ﬁnancial investment behaviour. 
For each of these characteristics, we created one dummy variable indicating the presence of a given status at time t À 2 and one dummy variable capturing the entry in such status between t À 2 and t À 1. We also calculate the logarithm of the number of years elapsed from the entry in the status considered as of time t À 2. Finally, individual conditions not representing an absorbing status are modelled by a dummy variable identifying the exits from this status between t À 2 and t À 1. Information about life insurance ﬁrst investment is summarized by three variables: a dummy indicating whether individuals have invested in life insurance at time t À 2 or earlier and 0 otherwise; a dummy variable taking on value 1 if respondents ﬁrst invested in lifeinsurance between t À 2 and t À 1. This latter variable is meant to capture the role played by recent entries in the life insurance markets. 
The third variable is the logarithm of the number of years elapsed as of time t À 2 from the ﬁrst life insurance investment. 
This way we model the time-variation in the effect of purchasing life insurance policies on later ﬁnancial behaviour. 
Our speciﬁcations control for time-invariant covariates such as country of residence, gender, birth-cohort, education, and early life conditions describing respondents’ status at 10 years of age (number of rooms per capita, number of books in the accommodation, relative school performance in maths and language subjects, occupation of the main breadwinner, presence of siblings and homeownership of parental home). 
We also include a dummy variable taking on value 1 for individuals who have ever been self-employed as of t À 2 to take into account their incentives to invest in life insurance in order to be exempted from seizure by creditors in case of bankruptcy. 
Finally, we make use of the time series of the German stock index (Deutscher Aktien-Index, DAX) to measure the returns on investing in the stock market. 
The DAX index has the advantages of measuring the stock market performance of an important European stock exchange (Frankfurt), having a long time series available (1950–2009) and being only marginally affected by inﬂation, which ensures that its variation over time reﬂects actual ﬂuctuations in the stock market returns (our dynamics of interest). 
We deﬁne the returns on investing in the stock market at time t À 1 as the difference in the logarithm of the DAX index at times t À 1 and t À 2. 5. Estimation results We model the hazard rate of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds at a given age conditional on previous investments in life insurance and the wide set of individual characteristics and macroeconomic indicators discussed in the previous section. 
We exclude from the analysis mortgage-related life insurance policies, which normally are not an investment instrument, but are required by the lender to cover the risk of premature death of the mortgagor. 
Three alternative speciﬁcations have been deﬁned. 
The ﬁrst includes all the individuals in our sample without missing values for the variables of interest. The second and third focus on males only, who much more often have complete work histories. 
This allows us to add, in the third speciﬁcation, a measure of lifetime income that is based on the discounted sum of labour and pension incomes earned over the whole life-cycle (Weiss, 2012). 
Table A.1 in the Appendix shows sample averages of the variables used in our regressions. 
Table A.2 summarizes the results for the three speciﬁcations considered. 
Standard errors are clustered at the household level to allow for within household correlation in ﬁnancial market participation. 
If we focus on the ﬁrst speciﬁcation, our estimates imp ly that overall the hazard rate is highest for Sweden and Denmark and lowest for Austria and Mediterranean countries. 
Cultural differences across countries have recently been linked to cultural factors such as trust (see Guiso, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2008, for speciﬁc evidence on the role of trust in explaining low stock market participation in Southern European countries) 1 . 
The hazard rate is higher for men and shows a hill-shaped relationship with age attaining its peak at the age of 53. Also, older cohorts have a lower propensity to invest in risky ﬁnancial markets. 
The effect of education is nonlinear as well. 
However, up to 20 years of education, the hazard rate increases with the number of years spent at school. 
Early life conditions are imp ortant predictors of later ﬁnancial behaviour. 
If the breadwinner in the household at the age of 10, who is typically one of the parents, has a blue-collar occupation, individuals are less likely to become stock-owners. 
Those who lived at the age of 10 in an accommodation with a higher number of rooms per capita show a higher propensity to enter the risky ﬁnancial markets. 
In addition, the hazard rate increases with the number of books at home and with self-assessed mathematical and language abilities. 
Having parents occupied in high-skilled jobs as well as living in homes with more rooms per capita and more books is typical of better-off and better-educated households, who can be expected to have higher ﬁnancial literacy and higher levels of familiarity with managing ﬁnancial portfolios. 
Individuals growing up in such contexts are therefore more likely to invest their savings in ﬁnancial markets and so are people who are more conﬁdent about their mathematical ability. 
As for macroeconomic indicators, we notice that being in and entering periods of high inﬂation or recession are associated with a lower hazard rate of investing in stocks and mutual funds at time t. The reverse effect is found when leaving high inﬂation and recession periods. 
This is consistent with the notion that stocks become attractive when the economy is likely to start doing well, as is often the case when an inﬂationary episode has been brought to its end by a successful monetary policy. 
The stock exchange returns at time t À 1 are powerful predictors of the decision of entering the stock market at time t. The higher are the returns on stocks, the higher is the propensity to invest in this type of asset. 
Of particular interest to us is the relationship between life insurance purchase and the hazard rate of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds. 
If we look at the upper panel of Table 1, we ﬁnd that those who ﬁrst invested in life insurance policies between periods t À 2 and t À 1 are much more likely to ﬁrst invest in stock and mutual funds at t. Also, those who were already policyholders at t À 2 are more likely to start participating in the stock and mutual fund market. 
The two parameters are statistically signiﬁcant and of similar magnitude. 
The number of years elapsed from the ﬁrst life insurance investment does not seem to play any signiﬁcant role. 
To assess the economic relevance of these correlations, the lower panel of Table 1 reports the hazard rate of a baseline individual with ﬁxed characteristics (listed at the bottom of the table), who has not yet invested in life insurance policies, and shows how the hazard rate varies with the life insurance variables included in our speciﬁcation. 
The baseline individual we consider (who is 40 years old) has a 0.8% probability of starting to invest in stocks and mutual funds within a year. 
Everything else constant, if we assume that the baseline individual has bought a life insurance policy at time t À 2 or earlier the hazard rate increases to 1.1%. 
A slightly wider variation is found when we look at the decision of buying a life insurance more recently (between t À 2 and t À 1). On the basis of our parameter estimates, we can predict the hazard rate of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds for the individuals in our sample. 
Fig. 4 plots the averages of the predicted hazard rate by age and by investment in life insurance policies at time t À 2 or earlier. 
In both groups the age proﬁle of the hazard is hump shaped and peaks around 50 years of age, but the age proﬁle for those with no previous investments in life insurance is much ﬂatter. 
Individuals who have already invested in life insurance policies show a higher hazard rate of entering the ﬁnancial markets of stocks and mutual funds at any age. 
Such differential is not constant over the life-cycle since the difference between the two groups is wider between 40 and 60 years of age. 
1 For a more general appraisal of trust and economic behaviour, see Fehr (2009). 
For ways to measure trust, Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and Soutter (2000) provide a useful analysis. 
The results of our second speciﬁcation show that all the considerations made above still hold when we restrict our estimation sample to males only. 
The sample size decreases to 300,000 observations. 
Previous investments in life insurance policies are still associated with an increase in the hazard rate of entering the stock market. 
On the one hand, having purchased a life insurance at time t À 2 or earlier remains a strong predictor of the hazard rate of interest. On the other hand, recent investments in life insurance are still positively correlated with the probability of becoming stock owners, although the signiﬁcance of this relationship is limited by the higher standard errors due to the smaller sample size. 
The role played by macroeconomic indicators and individual characteristics is similar to the one discussed when considering the whole sample. 
Table 1 shows that the baseline hazard rate is equal to 0.8% and increases up to more than 1% when previous investments in life insurance took place. 
Our ﬁrst two speciﬁcations control for a wide set of time invariant and time-varying indicators that correlate with the amount of economic resources available throughout respondents’ life (in particular, employment, home-ownership and early life conditions for breadwinner occupations, number of rooms per capita and ownership of parental home). 
Indeed, the portfolio composition of individuals is crucially related to the amount of economic resources they can invest. We further exploit the richness of SHARELIFE data by deﬁning a further speciﬁcation controlling for individual lifetime income including labour and pension income earned throughout individual’s life. 
Lifetime income proves to be an important determinant of stock-ownership. 
The higher is the lifetime income, the higher is the hazard rate of ﬁrst investing in stocks and mutual funds. 
Even after introducing this additional control for lifetime resources, individuals who have already a life-insurance at time t À 2 are more likely to ﬁrst invest in stock-ownership. 
Those who invest in life insurance between t À 2 and t À 1 are again more likely to invest in the stock market later. 
Our estimation sample considered so far excludes France since (whole) life-insurance policies are included into individual retirement accounts. 
As we pointed out before, there are several similarities between life insurance policies and individual retirement accounts. 
In particular, both assets are associated with favourable tax treatments and in recent years tax-exemptions shifted from the former to the latter type of asset. 
In addition, Fig. 1 shows that in Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain individual retirement accounts are often one the ﬁrst ﬁnancial investments undertaken by all cohort groups but the oldest one. 
This pattern becomes even more evident for France. 
In all the cohorts considered, about 40% of the ﬁrst investments have been done in individual retirement accounts (and about 20% in life insurance policies).

In order to account for the substitutability between life insurance and individual retirement account investments, we repeat our empirical exercise and assess the role of previous investments in either life insurance or individual retirement accounts on subsequent stock-ownership decisions. 
France is now included in the estimation sample, which now consists of 840,000 observations. 
Table A.3 reports our regression results for the full sample and for males only. 
All our previous results are conﬁrmed. 
Individuals who have already invested in either life insurance policies or individual retirement accounts at time t À 2 have always higher hazard rates of ﬁrst stockownership. 
A positive correlation is also found for recent investments in life insurance or individual retirement accounts taking place between t À 2 and t À 1, irrespective of controlling or not for lifetime income. 
Finally, Table A.4 shows the hazard rate predictions and its variations with life insurance investments calculated for the same baseline individual considered before. 
Our previous ﬁndings prove to be remarkably robust to broadening the deﬁnition of life-insurance policies to include individual retirement accounts and adding France to the sample. 
Both baseline hazard rates and their variations associated with previous investments in life insurance or individual retirement accounts align with those found when considering life insurance investments only. 
6. Conclusions Our ana lysis has revealed that previous life insurance investment plays an important role in explaining stock market participation decisions. 
After conditioning on a wide set of individual characteristics and macroeconomic indicators, individuals who purchased a life insurance policy are more likely to invest in stocks and mutual funds later. 
Our results are consistent with the notion that life insurance policies play an educational role in ﬁnancial investment: over our sample (that covers the whole post WWII period) it was common for Europeans to start their ﬁnancial wealth accumulation by purchasing life insurance policies, that quite often required regular payments over the years and were invested mostly in bonds but also in stocks. 
Given the low levels of ﬁnancial literacy observed across European households (Lusardi, 2008), this may have well been the ﬁrst opportunity for most households to learn about the existence of stocks and mutual funds. 
The evidence we present is also consistent with some behavioural ﬁnance models, such as Shefrin and Statman (2000) behavioural portfolio theory model and the lifecycle model with bounded rationality by Binswanger (2011). 
In both, life insurance investment can be the natural vehicle for the low aspiration layer or the worst case scenario, whereby the individual attempts to prevent poverty or unacceptable low consumption levels in adverse circumstances. 
Investment in stocks and mutual funds comes later, in response to the desire to reap the beneﬁts of high returns in normal times. 
Because of its mostly descriptive nature, the analysis presented in this paper is ill-suited to discriminate between a standard model of inter-temporal optimization with incomplete information (ﬁnancial illiteracy) and nonstandard preferences driving decision making under uncertainty. 
A full structural model is beyond the scope of this paper, but the pattern we highlighted should contribute in our opinion to the growing literature on puzzles that household portfolio theory should be able to explain.
