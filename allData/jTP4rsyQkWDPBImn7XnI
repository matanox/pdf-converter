Accepted 30 th August, 2013 ABSTRACT A pot experiment under greenhouse conditions was conducted in P and Zn deficient alkaline soil at Mekelle Agricultural Research Center in 2009 to evaluate the effect of P and Zn nutrients on nodulation of faba bean (Vicia faba L.CS20DK). 
A factorial combination of P and Zn fertilization with three levels of P (0, 30 and 60 kgPha -1 ) and with three levels of Zn (0, 15 and 25 kgZnha -1 ) was laid in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). 
Three replications (3 blocks) were used to assess nodulation (nodule number and dry weight), nutrient content (P, N, and Zn) of the faba bean plant leaves. 
The results showed that P fertilization increased significantly (p<0.05) nodulation and the concentration of P leaves in faba bean plant. 
Similarly, Zn fertilization caused significant (p<0.05) increase in Zn concentration of the leaves. 
The combined fertilization of P and Zn had significant effect on nutrient concentration (P, N and Zn) of faba bean leaves. 
From the study, it is possible to conclude that nodulation increases when phosphorus fertilizer increases. 
The combined fertilization of high level of P showed that the dilution effect on Zn content was due to the growth enhancement which is sometimes called P induced Zn deficiency. 
The applications of the combined fertilization of zinc and phosphorus have a significant effect on P, N and Zn concentration in the plant leaves. 
These parameters are highly associated with the yield of faba bean. 
Therefore, researchers can use this finding for a further study. 
Key words: Faba bean, zinc, phosphorus, nodulation. 
INTRODUCTION Ethiopia is the largest producer of Cool-Season Food Legumes (CSFL) in Africa (Yamane and Skjelvg, 2003). 
Among the CSFL, a faba bean variety (Vicia faba L.) is grown by subsistence farmers during the cool main rainy season (June to September). 
In Ethiopia, faba bean, which occupies about 34% of the total land area under pulses, is the most important pulse crop (CSA, 2007). 
The dry grains of this legume have been an important protein source for human diet for centuries because the animal protein is expensive or not sufficiently available. 
The straw of the crop is also used as animal food and soil fertility restorer (El Tinay et al., 1993; Ammanuel et al., 2000; Habtegebriel et al., 2007). 
The effect of P and Zn and their interactions on the amount of N2 fixation of legumes could be critical. Both nutrients are involved in the host plant growth and also play specific roles in nodule development and N2 fixation processes. 
In addition to the P functions in energy storage, transfer, and serving as structural component of cells, it has a major role in host plant metabolism, for example, in controlling the rates of photosynthetic carbon-assimilate production, where the requirement of N by plants declines by P- deficiency (Jackbson, 1995). 
Relatively, large amount of phosphorous is also required over the host plant need in nodule growth and N2 fixation processes (Israel, 1987; Habtegebriel et al., 2007).

221 Zinc is involved in various host plant metabolic processes, nodule growth and N2 fixation processes. 
In Zn deficient plants, protein synthesis and protein levels are markedly reduced but amino acids and amides are accumulated as Zn is the structural component of the protein synthesizing polymerase enzyme; hence, in Zn deficient plants, the protein synthesis of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is impaired (Fageria et al., 2009). 
Deficiency of Zn in legumes is found to reduce the number and size of nodules as it is possibly involved in leghaemoglobin synthesis (Marsh and Waters, 1985). 
The other important aspect of P and Zn nutrition is the interaction effect between them, especially in soils marginally deficient in P and Zn. If P and Zn are fertilized together in such soils, crop yields would be reported to have increased with positive interaction of P and Zn (Havlin et al., 2005). 
However, high P-availability or fertilization of P alone is found to induce Zn deficiency in plants, commonly known as P-induced Zn deficiency (Cakmak and Marschner, 1987). 
At high P-availability, the physiological availability of Zn is decreased, where its solubility and mobility both within the cell and in long distance transported to the shoot apex is also affected (Cakmak and Marschner, 1987). 
Furthermore, with Zn deficient plant, cellular regulation of P uptake is impaired, causing absorption of toxic levels of P and transportation to plant tops, creating symptoms resembling Zn deficiency (Havlin et al., 2005). 
High soil P availability or fertilization also increases the shoot to root ratio of plants, resulting in short root length, thus, suppressing mycorrhizal uptake of Zn, which is the major Zn acquisition process by plants. 
The requirement of P and Zn by faba bean is relatively high. 
Faba bean may require P and Zn fertilization in the range of 20 to 30 kg P ha -1 and 10 to 25 kg Zn ha -1 (Prasad and Power, 1997). 
Use of mineral fertilizers to increase crop productivity by Ethiopian farmers is low and the use of micronutrient fertilization is uncommon. 
Limited studies on the effect of P on nodulation and N2 fixation (Habtegebriel and Singh, 2006) on pea, and nodulation and N 2 fixation on faba bean (Amanuel and Tanner, 1991; Habtegebriel et al., 2007) are reported for Ethiopian conditions. 
However, studies on the effect of P and Zn fertilization to CSFL on soils deficient in P and Zn are generally missing in Ethiopia. 
Thus, this study was conducted in greenhouse pot experiments to assess the effect of combined fertilization of different rates of P and Zn on nodulation of faba bean plants using a calcareous alkaline soil that is deficient in P and Zn nutrients. 
Highland soils of Ethiopia are low in soil organic matter, and dominantly deficient in major nutrients. 
The availability of P and micronutrients in alkaline calcareous soils is curtailed mainly by the fixing potential of these soils to nutrients like P and Zn; hence, limiting their plant available concentrations. 
The effect of P and Zn and their interaction on plants is known, but the extent of limiting the nodulation and N2 fixation of grain legumes is little known in calcareous dry land soils of Northern Ethiopia. 
Thus, it is important to study the effect of P and Zn nutrients and their interaction on nodulation potential of one of the common grain legumes- faba bean (V. faba L.). 
A preliminary greenhouse study on the effect of the combined fertilization of different rates of P and Zn on nodulation of faba bean will be conducted using an alkaline soil deficient in both nutrients. 
This will logically lead to a similar study at field-scale, which may be possible to recommend the rates needed to optimize the yield of faba bean on these soils. 
The main objective of the study is to examine the effect of Zn and P fertilization and their interaction on nodulation and accumulation of these nutrients in faba bean plant. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS General description of the experimental area The greenhouse pot experiment was conducted at the Mekelle Research Institute, Tigray- northern Ethiopia at 13°14’N and 39°32’E, and at 2100 m above sea level from October first to the end of December, 2009. 
The site of the greenhouse is found in the semi-arid agro-ecological zone of Ethiopia. 
From the center of Mekelle town, it is located 3 km to the north. 
The soil was collected from Elala from the nearby farmers’ fields. 
Soils and climate The area has a bimodal rainfall with an annual average rainfall of 453.3 mm. The minimum and maximum temperature of the area is 12.3 and 27.1°C, respectively (TARI, 2009). 
Rainfall is distributed between the short rainfall season (March to April) and the main rainy season (June to September). 
This pattern is, however, extremely variable with high probability of no rainfall during the short rainfall season. 
According to FAO/UNESCO (1984), the soil from which the pot experiment was conducted is classified as Cambisol. 
Soil extraction and plant sampling and analysis Cambisols are used to conduct pot experiment in the greenhouse. 
Soil medium for the greenhouse experiments was taken from 0 to 50 cm depth with the help of a spade on October 17 th 2009. 
The soil was air dried under shade and ground with a wooden roller and then passed through a 2 mm sieve. 
The soils were used to fill plastic pots having 20 cm diameter, depth of 30 cm and capacity of 10 kg. For the analysis of some soil physical and chemical properties, a composite soil sample was collected using Academia Journal of Agricultural Research; Weldu and Habtegriel. 
222 auger from the field at 0 to 50 cm soil depth before planting. 
The collected soil samples were bulked to make a composite sample. 
The sample was air-dried, ground, sieved to pass 2 mm size screen and stored in sealed plastics for laboratory analysis. 
The composite soil sample was analyzed for some soil parameters at Mekelle Agricultural Research Center Soil Laboratory. 
The pH of the soil was measured in a suspension of a 1: 2.5 soil to water ratio as described by Jackson (1958), organic carbon was determined by the method described by Walkley and Black (1934) and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) was determined by Ammonium Acetate method. 
The availability of soil phosphorus was analyzed using Olsen method (Olsen et al., 1954). 
To determine the available potassium in the soil, the sample was extracted with Morgan solution and K in the extract was measured by flame photometer. 
The total nitrogen was determined by Kjeldehal method (Sahlemedhin and Taye, 2000) and the available calcium carbonate was determined by the method described by Jackson (1970). 
The availability Zn was determined by using Diethylene Triamine Penta Acetic Acid (DTPA) extraction, a procedure developed by Lindsay and Norvell as outlined by Sahlemedhin and Taye (2000). 
Particle size was determined by international pipette method (Sahlemedhin and Taye, 2000).These aforementioned parameters were analyzed at the soil laboratory of Tigray Agricultural Research Center. 
Experimental design and treatments A factorial combination of two factors, P and Zn, P with three levels ( 0, 30, and 60 kg P ha -1 ) and Zn with three levels (0, 15, and 25 kg Zn ha -1 ) was laid in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with six replication. 
23 kg N ha -1 and 60 kg K ha -1 were applied to all pots as starter-N and basal dressing, respectively. 
Triple superphosphate (46% P), Urea (46% N), KCl and ZnSO 4 .7H 2 O (22.75% Zn) were used as a source of fertilizers for the greenhouse experiment. 
Faba bean (V. faba L. CS20DK) was obtained from the Ethiopian Seed Agency (ESA). 
The inoculant used was Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar. 
viciae strain EAL-110, obtained from the National Soil Research Laboratories, Microbiology Unit (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). 
The legume seeds were inoculated at the time of sowing with a powder containing an equivalent of 10 8 viable bacteria cells g powder -1 . 
Prior to inoculation, the seeds were surface-sterilized as outlined by Habtegebriel and Singh (2007). 
The seeds were washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, rinsed with sterilized water, shaken for 5 min in 30% (v/v) H202 which were diluted to 5% content, and rinsed again with sterilized water four times. 
The seeds were soaked overnight in distilled water and made ready for inoculation and sowing. 
Four faba bean seeds were planted for every pot which was later thinned to plants after 10 days of emergence. 
The actual rates of treatments (P and Zn), starter-N and basal dressing-KCl were calculated one plant per pot basis by taking 50 plants m -2 density of field experiments into consideration (Yamane and Skjelvg, 2003). 
Combined fertilizers (P + Zn + N + K) were placed 5 × 5 cm to the side and below the seed at planting. 
The date of sowing was October 17 th 2009. 
Green house experimental condition The maximum and minimum average temperature recorded during the greenhouse experiment was 24 and 13°C respectively. 
The pots were arranged with a distance of 20 cm between pots of a block and 20 cm between blocks. 
The crop was kept free of weeds by hand picking every week after emergence. 
For the first 14 days after sowing, soils were maintained at 75% field capacity, using deionized water. 
Thereafter, the pots were maintained at field capacity by frequent watering to weight. 
The pots were randomized in the greenhouse after each watering to eliminate any environmental effects, especially, solar radiation. 
The greenhouse experiment was conducted between October and December, 2009. 
Plant tissue sampling and analysis The three randomly selected blocks of faba bean plant from the six randomized complete blocks arranged at the beginning of the experiment were used for plant tissue sampling at 50% flowering. 
The plants were cut at ground level and the youngest leaves (youngest fully emerged leaf and the apical growth of each plant) were collected and separated from the rest of the plants for the analysis of Zn, P, and N concentrations at 50% flowering from each treatment (Brennan, 2005). 
The faba bean leaves samples were washed in sequence, first in detergent solution (0.2% liquid detergent), then, in dilute HCl (0.1N HCl solution) and finally, in deionized water. 
The extra moisture was wiped out and the sample was placed in new paper bags and dried to 70°C for 48 h. The plant analyses for these nutrients were conducted at the Mekelle soil laboratory of Agricultural Research Center. 
The dried leaves were ground in a stainless steel grinder, passed through a 0.5 mm sieve and weighed. 
For the determination of Zn concentration in the leaves of faba bean plant, part of the sample was digested using nitric and perchloric acid mixture. 
The digested samples were analyzed for zinc using a double beam Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) (GBC-902). 
Phosphorus in the faba bean leaves was determined from ashed samples of the ground leaves using a Dry Ashing Academia Journal of Agricultural Research; Weldu and Habtegriel. 
223 method (Sahlemedhin and Taye, 2000). 
The nitrogen in the plant leaves was determined by micro-kjeldhal using acid digested (mixtures of H2SO4 and HClO4) of the ashed leaf samples (Sahlemedhin and Taye, 2000). 
Nodulation assessment Nodule number and dry weight per plant was assessed from the randomly selected three blocks. 
The root of faba bean plant was washed by tap water. 
Nodules remaining in the soil were picked by hand. 
Nodules attached to each plant root were also removed and separately spread on a sieve for some minutes until the water had drained from the surface of the nodule. 
Finally, the average number of nodules plant -1 was recorded for each treatment. 
After the nodules were oven dried to 65°C for 48 h, the average nodule weight per plant was measured for each treatment. 
Statistical analysis The greenhouse from the Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) data was analyzed using GenStat Discovery Edition 3. Two factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to evaluate the main and interaction effects of the treatments (P and Zn-fertilization) on nodulation, N, Zn and P nutrient accumulation in the leaves of faba bean. 
LSD was used to compare treatment means and the probability significance level of a treatment effects and the correlations were evaluated at α=0.05. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical and chemical analysis of the soil The results of the analysis for some selected physical and chemical properties of the soil used in the pot experiment are given in Table 1. The soil is silt clay, alkaline and calcareous with calcium carbonate content of 17% (Havlin et al., 2005). 
The soil is non-saline with low organic matter content (<5%) and deficient in total N content, typical for semi-arid soils (Landon, 1991; Brady and Weil, 2002). 
The alkaline pH and high CaCO3 content of the soil indicate the fixing potential of the soil of P, Zn and other micronutrient metal ions. 
This could also be seen from the concentration analysis values for the availability of P and Zn in which the available P and Zn contents place the soil in the deficient P (4 to 7 ppm of Olsen-P) and deficient Zn (0 to 0.5 ppm) categories that are in low range or deficient content category (Landon, 1991; Havlin et al., 2005). 
Nodulation Nodulation was assessed at 50% flowering stage of the faba bean plant for the nodule number and dry nodule weight. 
The color was checked and showed invariably pink indicating rhizobium infection of the roots. 
The data for the main interaction effects of P and Zn on nodule number and nodule weight at 50% flowering is shown in Table 2. The main effect of the different rates of P on dry nodule weight and nodule number was significant (P≤ 0.05). 
At a rate of 60 kg ha -1 , the mean values of P showed the highest nodule dry weight of 18.4 mg plant -1 and number of 103 nodules plant -1 . 
These results are in line with the findings of Israel (1987), Amanuel and Tanner (1991) and Leidi and Rodiguez-Navarro (2000). 
These authors found that P fertilization increased significantly nodule number, mass, and amount of N2 fixed by pea and faba bean. 
On the other hand, though no statistically significant effect on nodule number and weight due to Zn fertilization was observed, there was an increasing trend for nodule number and dry weight with increasing Zn fertilization (Table 3). In another experiment by Elshkweer (1983), however, significant nitrogenase activity was recorded due to high correlation with nodule number and weight of faba bean. 
Similarly, the interaction between zinc and phosphorus fertilization was also not significantly affected (P≤ 0.05) for nodule weight and nodule number. 
P and Zn fertilization on P, Zn and N contents of faba bean leaves The effect of fertilization of P and Zn on the leaf contents of P, Zn and N were assessed at 50% flowering. 
The result for the main effects (Table 4) and interaction effects (Table 5) is subsequently discussed. 
The analysis in Table 4 shows that P fertilization had a significant effect (P≤ 0.05) on P concentration of the faba bean leaves. 
As the rate of phosphorus fertilizer increased, the P concentration of faba bean plants increased significantly. 
The highest and the lowest P content were observed at P2 (60 kg P ha -1 ) and P0 (0 kg P ha -1 ), respectively. 
This is in line with the reports of Jakobsen (1985), Habtegebriel and Singh (2006), that P fertilization to legumes increases considerably P content in shoots. 
Zn fertilization increases significantly (P≤ 0.05) the Zn concentration of faba bean plant leaves, ranging from (21.55 to 31.22 ppm), for treatments Zn 0 (0 kg Zn ha -1 ) and Zn2 (25 kg Zn ha -1 ) respectively. 
The yield and uptake of zinc is similar to sufficient increase with zinc fertilization in zinc deficient soils (Havlin et al., 2005). 
The interaction effect of the different rates of Zn (0, 15 and 25 kg Zn ha -1 ) and P (0, 30 and 60 kg P ha -1 ) fertilizer had statistically significant effect (P≤ 0.05) on P and Zn content of faba bean leaves (Table 5). When P and Zn were fertilized together at rates of P 1 (30 kg P ha -1 ) and Zn 1 (15 kg Zn ha -1 ), the content of Zn in the leaves of faba bean plant increased significantly from 23 (P0Zn0) ppm to 32 (P30Zn15) ppm, in contrast when P was fertilized in the Table 1.

highest rate (60 kg P ha -1 ), the concentration of zinc decreased significantly from 32 ppm (P 30 Zn 15 ) to 22 ppm (P 30 Zn 15 ), showing the dilution of zinc content due to growth enhancement brought by increased P fertilization (Marshner, 1993). 
During the fertilization of P and Zn together, the N content of faba bean leaves was observed to increase significantly (P≤ 0.05) (Table 5). This might be due to the controlling effect of P in photosynthetic carbon assimilation where the deficiency of P reduces the need for N (Jakobsen, 1995). 
Similarly, the involvement of Zn in N metabolism for example, synthesis of the amino acids tryptophan and photosynthesis affects the N content of faba bean plant (Elshkweer, 1983; Fageria, 2009). 
These results also confirm the results obtained by Singh et al. (1984). 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS From this study, it is possible to conclude that there was significant effect of P fertilizer rates on nodulation of faba bean. 
Although, there was no significant effect due to the Zn Academia Journal of Agricultural Research; Weldu and Habtegriel.

Similarly, the combined fertilization of P and Zn fertilizers showed significant effect on P, Zn and N concentration of plant leaves. 
The combined fertilization of high level of P showed the dilution effect on Zn content due to growth enhancement brought by fertilization sometimes called P induced Zn deficiency. 
In conclusion, this study shows that the applications of combined fertilization of zinc and phosphorus have significant effect on P, N and Zn concentration in plant leaves.
