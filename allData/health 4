This review describes the literature on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity in many societies from all parts of the world. 
The amount of biological research on obesity has far exceeded that of social research, and biological research and the importance of its findings continue to grow. 
Understanding biological factors, however, cannot fully explicate human obesity without considering psychological, social, and cultural influences. 
For example, recent reports showing the genetic contribution to human obesity caution against an exclusively biological interpretation of their results and propose that the origins of human obesity lie in the interactions between vulnerabilities transmitted by heredity and the influences imposed by particular environments (Price, Cadoret, Stunkard, & Troughton, 1987; Price & Stunkard, in press; Stunkard, Foch, & Hrubec, 1986; Stunkard, Sarensen, et al., 1986). 
This review complements the findings of biological research on obesity with the findings of social research by examining a topic that has been extensively studied but not previously reviewed: SES and obesity. 
The possibility that SES might be related to body weight was first raised a century ago by Veblen (1889) in his speculation that thinness became an ideal of feminine beauty in "chivalric times" when it served as a status symbol of an emerging leisure class. 
Systematic data about such an SES-obesity relationship were not examined for many years. 
In the last 40 years the relationship between SES and obesity has been examined in 144 studies in both developed and developing societies. 
The focus of most of these investigations was not on the relationship between SES and obesity as such. 
Instead, most of these reports presented data about this relationSupport for this project was provided in part by Grant 2D32PE13000 from the U.S.

ship in the course of examining other topics. 
This literature is now large enough that an integrative review may prove useful in assessing the relationship between SES and obesity among men, women, and children in developing societies as well as in developed ones. 
This assessment is the subject of this review. 
Measurement Issues Before discussing the results of existing studies, we briefly address measurement of SES and obesity. 
This issue is important for discussion of the substantive findings, and discussing it first lessens the need to dwell on it in reviewing results of specific studies. 
There is little consensus about conceptualizing and measuring SES, and different researchers choose different measures. 
Studies have assessed SES with a wide variety of indicators, most frequently income or education and less often occupation or other measures. 
Most studies used only one measure, although some used several indicators or composite scales of SES. 
In children, SES of the parents or family was usually utilized. 
Obesity is defined as an excessive amount of body fat, with any cutoff on the continuum being arbitrary. 
Investigations in this review used several measures of obesity and body fatness, sometimes as dichotomous and sometimes as continuous measures. 
Some of the indicators used in these investigations were derived from standard weight and height tables, various weight/ height ratios, and skin-fold thicknesses at different sites. 
Some studies used several measures of obesity. 
Measuring obesity in children can be problematic because of the effects of growth and development. 
The measurement procedure may determine the significance and strength of the SES-obesity relationship reported in a study, and the relationship between SES and obesity may differ according to the measure of SES or obesity used. 
We comment on measures in a few studies, but our primary concern is the cumulative patterns in the literature. 
Because of vast differences between societies, we review studies of SES and obesity separately for developed and developing societies. 
Developed and developing societies can be differentiated on the basis of their level of modernization, with modern, Western industrialized societies classified as developed and societies with more traditional, non-Western agricultural social SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OBESITY261 structures classified as developing. 
We classify traditional subcultures within a larger developed society, such as aborigines in Australia, as developing societies. 
Because the review is limited to existing reports, the sample of published studies is not representative of all developed societies, and Japan and southern and eastern Europe are underrepresented. 
Several continents are represented among studies of developing societies. 
With these methodological considerations in mind, studies of the SES-obesity relationship are reviewed by type of society and by gender. 
Developed societies are considered first, with separate discussions of women, men, and children. 
Developing societies, with their separate relationships, are considered next. 
The review includes 144 published studies that provide information on SES and obesity—all that could be identified by an exhaustive search. 
The investigations are examined using individual studies as the unit of analysis (K. D. Hopkins, 1982), counting the number (and percentage) of studies that reported a particular pattern of SES-obesity relationships. 
This method has the advantage of including a broad range of samples and methods and the disadvantage of weighting large and small investigations equally. 
Relationships Between SES and Obesity Developed Societies: Women The first empirical study to focus on the relationship between SES and obesity found a remarkably strong inverse relationship among women: Obesity was six times more prevalent among women of lower SES than among those of upper SES (Goldblatt, Moore, & Stunkard, 1965; Moore, Stunkard, & Srole, 1962). 
These results were important because of the strength of the relationship between current SES and obesity, but the study went further. 
Using data from the stratified sample of the population of New York City collected by the Midtown Study of mental health (Srole, Langner, Michael, Opler, & Rennie, 1962), we also examined the relationship of parental SES, "SES of origin," with obesity. 
The Midtown Study placed great stress on the importance of SES of origin as a means of establishing directionality in the relationship between social variables and mental health, arguing that SES of origin served as an independent variable. 
The Goldblatt et al. (1965) study found that this critical variable, SES of origin, was related to the prevalence of obesity almost as strongly as was the subject's own SES. 
If the rationale of the Midtown researchers is correct, SES or some correlate of it thus serves as an independent variable in relation to obesity. 
Goldblatt et al. (1965) also found that the prevalence of thinness among women was the mirror image of that of obesity, varying directly with SES: the higher the SES, the greater the prevalence of thinness. 
The Goldblatt et al. (1965) study strongly suggested that SES of origin influences the prevalence of obesity in adults. 
Two recent longitudinal studies that followed the same people from childhood into adult life have provided even stronger evidence (Braddon, Rodgers, Wadsworth, & Davies, 1986; Power & Moynihan, 1988). 
In two large British samples there were no differences in overweight and obesity by SES among boys and only trivial differences among girls (Peckham, Stark, Simonite, & Wolff, 1983). 
By adulthood, such differences had been firmly established. 
The National Health Survey study of 5,362 people revealed that both men and women who had been raised in manual-class homes were significantly more likely to be overweight at age 36 than were those from non-manual-class homes (Braddon et al., 1986). 
Similarly, the National Child Development Study of over 9,000 people showed that SES differences in obesity were established at an even earlier age; by age 23 the difference between higher and lower social classes in the percentage of obese persons was threefold among men and twofold among women (Power & Moynihan, 1988). 
Many studies in the United States confirm the inverse relationship between SES and obesity for women. 
The results are striking in their consistency. 
Table 1 summarizes reports from the United States in chronological order. 
Of the 30 that provide data on women, 28 (93%) reported an inverse association, and not a single study found a direct relationship. 
Only two (7%) failed to report the inverse relationship, and one of them, confined to a small sample (N = 83) of Black dieters, had very limited statistical power (McGee & Hale, 1980). 
Kumanyika (1987) noted that although Black women are frequently obese, socioeconomic status may not account for that pattern, but Gillum (1987) showed that there is an inverse relationship between SES and obesity for both Black and White women. 
In summary, no matter what measure of SES or obesity was used or what population group was studied, the results were monotonously similar: SES was inversely related to obesity among women. 
Findings in other developed countries were very similar to those in the United States. 
In a variety of countries using many methodologies, 18 (75%) of these studies found an inverse association, and 5 (21%) found no relationship (Table 2). Only 1 study (4%) reported a positive association, and it was confined to a small sample of a very special population: migrants to Belgium (Susanne, 1979). 
Thus studies from Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Holland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden all replicated the U.S. findings of a consistent inverse relationship between SES and obesity among women. 
Developed Societies: Men Among men in developed countries, there was none of the consistency and strength of the inverse association between SES and obesity found among women. 
In fact, the distribution was bimodal, as likely to be direct as inverse (Table 1). The 27 studies in the United States are divided into 12 (44%) with an inverse relationship, 12 (44%) with a direct relationship, and 3 (11%) with no relationship. 
An important contribution to our understanding of the relationship between SES and obesity among men is made by the 22 U.S. studies that included both men and women. 
In all of these studies the tendency toward an inverse relationship was stronger among women. 
Thus, in 8 studies (36%) the relationship was inverse in women and direct in men. 
In 10 others (45%) it was inverse in both women and men, and in each case the relationship was stronger in women. 
In 3 studies (14%) the relationship was inverse in women and absent in men; in 1 other study (5%) it was absent in women and direct in men. 
The findings on men in other developed countries are similar to those in the United States (Table 2). An inverse relationship was found in 22 studies (56%), a direct relationship in 8 studies 262JEFFERY SOBAL AND ALBERT J.

HANES = Health and Nutrition Examination (21%), and no relationship in 8 studies (21%). 
In addition, a Ushaped curvilinear relationship was found in one study (3%). 
Considering all 66 studies of men in the United States and other developed countries, we find that 52% found the inverse relationship characteristic of women, while 30% found just the opposite, a direct relationship. 
Only 17% of the studies failed to find a relationship between SES and obesity, and these studies included less than 3% of all the subjects studied. 
By far the most common results were opposite in direction: either an inverse relationship or a direct relationship. 
How can these findings be interpreted? 
One possibility is that there were differences in measurement of SES, obesity, or both. 
Another possibility is that the differences resulted from secular trends, and that the relationship changed from the direct relationship characteristic of developing countries (which will be discussed later) to an inverse relationship with increasing modernization. 
Neither possibility is apparent in the data. 
A number of other possible explanations exist for these contradictory findings in men. 
The opposing relationships could be due to differences in food intake or energy expenditure between samples, differences in demographic variables, or differences in such mediating variables as age, race, smoking, chronic disease, or alcohol intake.

Smoking provides an example of the problems in explaining the relationship between SES and obesity. 
Smoking is strongly associated with SES in an inverse relationship (Fehily, Phillips, & Yarnell, 1984; Jarvik, Cullen, Gritz, Vogt, & West, 1977; Khosla & Lowe, 1972; Remington et al., 1985; Rose & Marmot, 1981). 
Smoking is also associated with a lower body weight (Hofstetter, Schutz, Jequier, & Wahren, 1986; Wack & Rodin, 1982). 
Smoking could thus provide a plausible mechanism for the direct relationship between SES and obesity found in some studies of men, with the higher prevalence of smoking in lower social classes accounting for less frequent obesity. 
But how does one account for the inverse relationship between SES and obesity in other studies of men and in most studies of women? 
Unfortunately, the available data on smoking are insufficient to answer this question, and the data on other variables such as chronic illness or alcohol consumption are even less adequate.

'The paradox of the different relationships between SES and obesity in men in developed societies is a fascinating problem for further study. 
Developed Societies: Children An examination of the association between SES and obesity turns naturally to a consideration of the relationships in children. 
Several questions emerge from the data on adults. 
Is the social class into which one is born a determinant of obesity in adult life? 
When does a relationship between SES and obesity become apparent? 
At what age does the strong relationship between SES and obesity among females begin? 
Is there a relationship among young males that disappears or attenuates in later life? 
Although the literature does not answer all of these questions, it does provide evidence for some. 
The relationship between SES and obesity in girls in developed societies is weaker and less consistent than that in women (Table 3). Among girls in the United States and other developed countries, 11 studies (35%) showed no relationship between SES and obesity, and the 21 studies that did show a relationship were divided into 13 studies (40%) in which the relationship was inverse and 8 studies (25%) in which it was direct. 
Among boys, the results are similar: about half (14 studies or 41 %) of all studies found no relationship between SES and obesity. 
The 20 studies that showed a relationship were fairly evenly divided: The relationship was direct in 9 studies (26%) and inverse in 11 (32%). 
Although there is marked variability of results between studies in children in different populations, there is strong consistency within studies. 
Most investigations found the same relationship among boys that they found among girls: When the relationship was direct, inverse, or absent in one sex, it was the same in the other sex. 
Such concordance occurred in all 14 U.S. 
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OBESITY 265 studies that examined both boys and girls and in 13 of the 17 such studies in other developed countries. 
This within-study consistency and between-studies variability among children in developed societies raises the question as to what accounts for these differences. 
Perhaps they are due to some differences in methodology, such as differing measures of SES and obesity or differing data collection procedures. 
One promising possibility is that age of the child may determine the difference: The relationship of SES with obesity may increase with age. 
Sufficient information about the ages of children is not available in most of these studies to test this hypothesis, and it deserves further study. 
There is a consistent inverse relationship between SES and obesity among adult women and an equivocal relationship for adult men and for children of either sex. 
As the British longitudinal studies have shown, as girls become women, a powerful inverse relationship develops (Braddon et al., 1986; Peckham et al., 1983; Power & Moynihan, 1988). 
By contrast, no such differentiation occurs for boys as they become men, and the variable patterns that characterize the relationship among children persist. A "socioeconomic reversal of fatness" for females has been proposed by Garn and his colleagues (Garn & Clark, 1974, 1976; Garn & Ryan, 1981). 
According to these authors, girls of lower SES are thinner than girls of upper SES in childhood, but the relationship reverses, and they become fatter during adolescence (Garn & Clark, 1974,1976; Garn & Ryan, 1981). 
Graphs in these reports, however, do not support conclusions of a developmental reversal, and no numerical data are presented. 
Developing Societies: Adults and Children The relationship between SES and obesity in developing countries is every bit as strong and consistent as that between SES and obesity among women in developed societies, but in the opposite direction. 
It should be recognized that the methodological quality of the studies conducted in developed societies is rarely matched in developing societies, and the measures used to assess SES and obesity in developing countries are often cruder. 
In several studies, for example, SES was assigned to individuals using the SES of the geographical location in which they lived rather than characteristics of the person such as income or education. 
Despite the methodological limitations of these studies, the relationship of SES and obesity in developing countries appears as robust as that found by the investigations of women in developed societies. 
Ten (91%) of the reports show that among adult women, SES was directly associated with obesity, precisely the opposite of the relationship in developed societies (Table 4). Among men, the same direct relationship was reported in 12 studies (86%). 
Only one study of women (9%) and two studies of men (16%) failed to find a direct relationship, and, most importantly, none found an inverse relationship. 
These findings are the more remarkable in that they were not limited to one geographical area but were present in studies in Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. 
The developmental origins of the direct relationship of SES and obesity among adults in developing countries are clear. 
In the 87% of the studies of children in which a relationship between SES and obesity was found, it was direct, and it occurred in both boys and girls (Table 5). Only two studies failed to find a relationship, and as with adults, no inverse relationships were reported. 
In one report on children it is interesting to note that the SES of the neighborhood was a better predictor of weight status than was the SES of the family (Koopman, Fajardo, & Bertrand, 1981). 
Mechanisms of Obesity A myriad of laboratory studies have shown that changes in body weight, especially in body fat, are the direct results of changes in energy balance (Garrow, 1978). 
A positive energy balance results in weight gain, a negative energy balance results in weight loss. 
A positive energy balance is achieved by either an increase in energy intake or a decrease in energy output; a negative balance is achieved by the converse. 
Energy intake is dependent solely on food consumption; energy output derives from basal metabolism, physical activity, and the thermic effect of food. 
Carefully controlled laboratory studies have found exquisitely precise relationships between changes in energy balance and changes in body weight (Garrow, 1978). 
These studies, however, have been short-term laboratory investigations. 
When one ventures outside the laboratory to longer term attempts to understand the origins of obesity, the picture becomes less clear. 
A major problem in population studies of this type is the apparent lack of relationship between food intake and body weight in adults (Keen, Thomas, & Jarrett, 1982; Keen, Thomas, Jarrett, & Fuller, 1979; Kromhout, 1983), adolescents (Bingham, McNeil, & Cummings, 1981; Hampton, Huenemann, Shapiro, & Mitchell, 1967), and infants (Vobecky, Vobecky, Shapcott, & Demers, 1983), even when the effects of physical activity are controlled. 
This problem has frequently been ascribed to the underreporting of food intake by some obese persons. 
But even when food intake and energy expenditure are carefully monitored in field studies, the relationship between energy intake and body weight is weak (Edholm, Fletcher, Widdowson, & McCance, 1955). 
New understanding of the role of metabolism in obesity helps explain this loose linkage between food intake and body weight in field studies. 
Griffiths and Payne (1976) reported that the metabolic rate of the 4-year-old children of obese parents was 10% lower than that of children of nonobese parents, even though the children were the same height and weight. 
The authors suggested that this difference could account for the later development of obesity in the children of obese parents, even on a caloric intake that did not differ from that of the children of normal-weight parents. 
This suggestion was realized a dozen years later by Roberts, Savage, Coward, Chew, and Lucas (1988), who measured caloric expenditure at the age of 3 months. 
At 1 year of age, infants with lower energy expenditure had become overweight, whereas those with greater energy expenditure had not. 
Such early differences in caloric expenditures seem unlikely to have arisen from environmental influences. 
It seems more probable that they are of genetic origin and that a lowered energy expenditure may be at least one means by which a genetic predisposition to obesity is expressed. 
These new metabolic findings do not contravene the basic mechanism of obesity: people become obese when their caloric intake exceeds their caloric expenditure. 
The findings do, however, indicate that an understanding of obesity requires appreci266 JEFFERY SOBAL AND ALBERT J.

ation of subtle quantitative aspects of energy balance. 
The manner in which SES acts as a moderator variable to influence energy balance is far clearer in developing societies than it is in developed societies and will be considered first. SES as a Moderator Variable in Developing Societies The low prevalence of obesity in lower SES groups in developing societies may be due to lack of food or even to famine, perhaps coupled with high energy expenditure. 
A greater preva- lence of obesity in individuals of higher SES appears to be due to their social influence in obtaining more adequate food supplies, coupled perhaps with cultural values favoring fat body shapes. 
Obesity may be a sign of health and wealth in developing societies, the opposite of its meaning in developed countries. 
An explanation of the strong positive relationship between SES and the prevalence of obesity in developing societies is provided by evolutionary history. 
Through the millennia, obesity was probably not a possibility for most people. 
Limited supplies of food characterized the lives of many of our ancestors and Table 5 Socioeconomic Status and Obesity Among Children and Adolescents from Developing/Non- Western Societies StudyGirlsBoysCountryPopulation Totals0 2 O 14 + 0 2 13 O + N Chang, Lee, Low, & Kuan (1963), Fry, Chang, Me Lee, &Ng(1965) Sabharwal, Morales, & Mendez (1966) Rea(1971) Garb &Stunkard( 1975) Christiansen, Moroa, & Herrera ( 1 975) Brink etal.( 1976) A.

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OBESITY 267 are present in many developing societies today. 
P. J. Brown and Konner (1987) report that 47% of developing societies have food shortages at least once a year, and in a third of these societies, the shortages are severe. 
This biologically based propensity to store fat is associated with, and may even influence, the cultural evolution that selects "fatness" as a highly valued trait (Seller, 1977). 
Among 81% of the 58 traditional cultures for which information is available, "plumpness" is viewed as an ideal of feminine beauty (P. J. Brown & Konner, 1987). 
These authors, for example, note that in Nigeria, pubescent daughters of the wealthy are sent to "fattening huts" before marriage. 
In many cultures in all parts of the world, fatness is a cultural symbol of social prestige as well as of sexual attractiveness. 
In such circumstances of relative deprivation, members of upper SES have access to sufficient food to realize this prestige symbol; members of lower SES do not. 
The prevalence of obesity in many developing societies increases with rising wealth and increasingly available food (P. J. Brown & Konner, 1987; Pawson & James, 1981; Trowell & Burkitt, 1981). 
In multicultural communities, individuals closer to the culture of the developed society are less skeptical about values favoring thinness (Stern, Pugh, Gaskill, & Hazuda, 1982). 
When we turn to the consideration of obesity in developed societies, however, we see a striking reversal of these attitudes among and toward women. 
SES as a Moderator Variable in Developed Societies As we have noted in our review of published studies, the way SES acts as a moderator variable is far less clear in developed societies than it is in developing societies. 
For one thing, in developed societies the pattern of association of SES and obesity differs between the sexes and between girls and women. 
For another, there is no single overriding force in developed societies, such as shortages of food. 
Thus SES must act in a different and more complex manner in developed societies than it does in developing societies. 
Four variables may mediate the relationship between SES and obesity. 
The two best studied mediating variables are dietary restraint and exercise, which exert their effects directly: dietary restraint by the reduction of caloric intake and exercise by the increase in caloric output. 
A variable that has been less extensively studied, social mobility, appears to exert its effect more indirectly by selecting for thinness. 
Finally, inheritance exerts an indirect effect, including genetic factors that, as new data suggest, may play a role in mediating the SESobesity relationship through influences on metabolic rate. 
Before discussing these four mediating variables, we consider in some detail a powerful influence on dietary restraint among women: societal attitudes toward obesity. 
Attitudes toward obesity in developed societies. 
The most striking relationship in developed societies is the strong inverse correlation between SES and obesity among women. 
Why is this relationship so strong among women and so inconsistent among men? 
A search for answers can start by examining societal attitudes toward obesity. 
Obesity is a severely stigmatized condition among women, and one of relative affective neutrality among men (Allon, 1981; Boskind-White & White, 1983;Cahnman, 1968;DeJong, 1980; Garner &Garfinkel, 1980a, 1980b; Hawkins & Clement, 1984; Maddox, Bach, & Liederman, 1968; Rodin, Silberstein, & Striegel-Moore, 1985; Sobal, 1984a). 
Garner and Garfinkle (1980a) documented a shift toward a thinner ideal body shape for women at least since 1960, and Rosen and Gross (1987) reported that the prevalence of dieting has increased among adolescents in studies over the last several decades. 
Not only is obesity far more severely stigmatized among women than it is among men, but women appear far more ready to accept the stigma. 
In the 1960s, adolescent girls were already reporting that they felt too fat (J. T. Dwyer, Feldman, Seltzer, & Mayer, 1969; Huenemann, Shapiro, Hampton, & Mitchell, 1966). 
This feeling has persisted and has become even more intense during the intervening years (Huon & Brown, 1984; Mann et al., 1983; Moss, Jennings, McFarland, & Carter, 1984; Nylander, 1971; Rodin etal., 1985; Waldron, 1983). 
These negative attitudes toward obesity among girls are already present at a very young age and are largely absent among boys (Feldman, Feldman, & Goodman, 1988). 
Thus body build is correlated with self-esteem among girls (but not among boys) as early as the fourth grade in school (Guyot, Fairchild, & Hill, 1981). 
Similarly, perceived weight and body satisfaction are negatively correlated among girls but not among boys (TobinRichards, Boxer, & Petersen, 1983). 
Boys in this study valued normal weight most highly and were equally dissatisfied with both overweight and underweight. 
In a similar study, Drenowski and Yee (1987) found similar rates of dissatisfaction with body shape among boys and girls. 
Among girls, however, the 90% who were dissatisfied all believed that they were too heavy. 
Among boys, the dissatisfied 90% was divided equally among those who believed that they were too heavy and those who believed that they were too thin. 
This difference in attitudes toward obesity between boys and girls has already found expression in dieting by age 13, at which time 80% of girls were dieting and only 10% of boys (Hawkins, Turell, & Jackson, 1983). 
Adolescence is the time par excellence among girls when attitudes toward weight assume adult proportions and when concern with obesity reaches a peak of intensity. 
Puberty brings an increase in body fat among girls that is 15% to 100% greater than that of boys (Marino & King, 1980). 
This increase in body fat occurs at a time of intensifying socialization into adult female values that include, notably, a concern with being too fat. 
Studies of health concerns in adolescents reveal that a substantial proportion of adolescents are concerned about being overweight (D. K. Walker etal., 1982). 
Over half of adolescents are concerned about being overweight; adolescents are more concerned about being overweight than about many other health issues such as drinking and birth control; and girls are consistently more concerned about overweight than are boys (Sobal, 1985, 1987; Sobal, Klein, Graham, & Black, 1988). 
Three studies of adolescents highlight the strength of concerns about overweight among girls and the absence of concerns among boys. 
The first study found a monotonic increase in the desire to be thin with increasing social class among girls aged 12 to 17, even when weight (which decreased with SES) was controlled (Dornbusch et al., 1984). 
Among boys, by contrast, there were only small and inconsistent differences in the desire for thinness among different social classes. 
Adolescent girls in the Dornbusch et al. study negatively evaluated the increase in body fat associated with pubertal sexual development and were dissatisfied with their heaviness because it represented fat. 
Adolescent boys, on the other hand, were satisfied with their heaviness because it represented muscularity. 
A second study, of En268JEFFERY SOBAL AND ALBERT J. STUNKARD glish adolescents, found similar results: A majority of girls of average weight reported that they felt fat and exercised a high degree of dietary restraint (Wardle & Beales, 1986). 
The third study found that college women in the United States judged their current appearance to be far heavier than their ideal (Fallon & Rozin, 1985). 
Furthermore, their perceptions of what men considered the ideal female figure were significantly thinner than the figures that the men actually preferred. 
By contrast, the men judged themselves to be close to the ideal in weight and believed that women also judged them to be so, whereas the women actually preferred thinner men. 
These studies show that the attitudes toward fatness and thinness of adolescent girls and boys foreshadow the later prevalence of fatness and thinness among women and men. 
These relationships among women include the inverse association of SES with obesity and the direct association with thinness (Goldblatt et al., 1965) and among men the finding that higher SES is associated with either obesity or thinness. 
Three studies have proposed explanations for the attitudes of adolescent girls. 
Rosenbaum (1979) noted that adolescent girls are keenly aware of the value that society places on attractiveness in women, that they desperately seek to be attractive, and that they see attractiveness and thinness as synonymous. 
Hill and Lynch (1983) further proposed that insecurity in adolescent girls leads to increasing compliance with sex-role-appropriate standards, which include thinness. 
Finally, dieting is perceived by adolescent girls as a sign of maturity, which they undertake in an effort to "grow up" (Steele, 1980). 
This evidence of the extent of the pressure on adolescent girls provides an explanation for the findings of the Midtown Study and of the recent British longitudinal studies that SES of origin is nearly as strongly related to the prevalence of obesity and thinness as is the adult's own SES (Braddon et al., 1986; Goldblatt et al., 1965; Power & Moynihan, 1988). 
The circumstances and values of life in the SES into which one is born may transmit pressures for thinness to adolescent girls during their socialization. 
There remains a question of why the pressure for thinness shows such a strong relationship with SES among women. 
An interpretation proposed by Striegel-Moore, Silberstein, and Rodin (1986) states, "The more a woman believes that what is fat is bad, that what is thin is beautiful, and beautiful is good, the more she will work toward thinness and be distressed about fatness" (p. 247). 
A determining factor in these beliefs is the extent to which women have accepted and internalized social norms about thinness and attractiveness, and such acceptance is also strongly associated with SES (Dornbusch et al., 1984). 
Clearly, there are powerful societal pressures for thinness and pervasive stigmatization of obesity in developed societies. 
How are these influences transformed into behaviors that result in a lower prevalence of obesity among women of higher SES? 
At least four influences may play a role: dietary restraint, physical activity, social mobility, and inheritance. 
Dietary restraint. 
The most important variable mediating the relationship between SES and obesity is probably dieting and dietary restraint. 
Women of higher SES diet more often than do women of lower SES (J. T. Dwyer & Mayer, 1970; Wyden, 1965), establishing a basis for the inverse relationship between SES and obesity. 
Among men, dieting is far less common, reducing its role in any SES-obesity relationship. 
Rosen and Gross (1987) found that 63% of high school girls were dieting, with those of higher SES dieting more than their lower SES counterparts. 
As many as 80% of 13-year-old girls report already having been on a diet (Hawkins et al., 1983), with almost as high a rate among 10-year-old girls (Mellin, Irwin, & Scully, 1986). 
Recent dieting has been pursued by 64% of Swedish adolescents (Nylander, 1971) and by 70% of American 10th- and llth-grade girls (Jakobovits, Halstead, Kelley, Roe, & \bung, 1977; Wadden, Foster, Stunkard, & Linowitz, in press). 
Surveys of adult women reveal a continuing high frequency of dieting (National Center for Health Statistics, 1985; Nielsen, 1979). 
Although most of this dieting stems from what has been called a "normative discontent" with weight (Striegel-Moore et al., 1986) and is not frankly pathological, extremes of dieting are manifested in both anorexia nervosa and bulimia. 
Each of these disorders is overwhelmingly more common among females than among males. 
Significantly, anorexia nervosa and probably also bulimia increase in prevalence with increasing SES (Garfinkle & Garner, 1982). 
Although it is clear that SES is related to weight control in women, less attention has been given to the reasons for this relationship. 
There are several possibilities. 
Women of higher SES have greater access to resources that facilitate dieting, such as programs for weight control and the more expensive foods that are perceived as aids to dieting (Sobal & Cassidy, 1987). 
Women of higher social status may be better organized and therefore more able to diet effectively. 
Upper status women also have higher educational levels, which gives them increased knowledge about nutrition and dieting. 
Furthermore, they may be more committed to the view that slimness is desirable and may be more personally motivated to attain slim figures. 
These issues have rarely been addressed in the literature and deserve attention in future investigations. 
Physical activity. 
The second direct influence on the disproportionate control of obesity among higher SES women is greater physical activity. 
Obese people are less active than nonobese ones (Baecke, Burema, Frijters, Hautvast, & Weiz-Wetzels, 1983; Braitman, Adlin, & Stanton, 1985; Chirico & Stunkard, 1960), and physical activity may play a part in the control of obesity (Thompson, Jarvie, Lahey, & Cureton, 1982). 
Several facts are apparent about the relationship between physical activity and SES. 
First, increasing mechanization of labor has markedly decreased the physical activity involved in all types of work. 
As a result, heavy physical activity is no longer an exclusively lower SES activity. 
Second, higher SES provides more leisure time and greater opportunity for recreational exercise, together with social pressures toward such exercise, and in fact, higher SES is associated with increased recreational physical activity (Greendorfer, 1978; National Center for Health Statistics, 1978; Wilson, 1980; White, Powell, Hogelin, Gentry, & Forman, 1987). 
Interestingly, pathologically increased physical activity characterizes the young women (usually of higher SES) whose dieting leads them into anorexia nervosa (Garfinkle & Garner, 1982). 
Third, higher status women may be more knowledgeable about the benefits of exercise. 
Social mobility. 
A third variable mediating the inverse relationship between SES and obesity among women is social mobility. 
Data about SES of origin in the Midtown Study (Goldblatt et al., 1965) made it possible to relate social mobility to obesity. 
Among downwardly mobile women (whose present SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OBESITY269 SES was lower than their SES of origin), the prevalence of obesity was 22%, which was greater than that among women who remained in the social class of their parents (18%) and far greater than that among those who were upwardly mobile (12%). 
The prevalence of thinness among women was the mirror image of that of obesity: Upwardly mobile women were much thinner than their counterparts who had a stable lifetime SES or whose SES declined. 
The same relationship was found in one of the British longitudinal studies: The prevalence of obesity among upwardly mobile women was significantly lower (5%) than among women who remained in their social class of origin (11%; Braddon et al., 1986). 
In neither of these studies was there a relationship between social mobility and obesity among men; this influence seems to be specific for women. 
A German study of medical patients also found that upwardly mobile women were thinner (Pflanz, 1963). 
Thinness and fatness play a role in social mobility for women through marriage (Rimm & Rimm, 1974; Sobal, 1984b) and for men through occupation (Hinkle et al., 1968). 
In a society that strongly stigmatizes obesity and rewards thinness, both marital and occupational social mobility are far less available to the obese and more available to thin people. 
Inheritance. 
A fourth variable mediating the relationship between SES and obesity is inheritance. 
SES of parents is one of the best predictors of the SES of their children (McClendon, 1976; Rosenfeld, 1978), and obesity of parents also is one of the best predictors of obesity among their offspring (Garn, Bailey, Solomon & Hopkins, 1981). 
The role of inheritance in the SESobesity relationship includes both social and genetic influences. 
Social transmission of wealth and other attributes of SES from parents to children plays a role in determining the SES of the children (McClendon, 1976; Rosenfeld, 1978). 
Additionally, values and beliefs about eating and exercise, as well as attitudes about obesity itself, are also instilled in children during the socialization process. 
Thus social inheritance plays a role in the relationship between SES and obesity by influencing both SES and obesity. 
Dramatic new findings regarding the genetic transmission of SES and obesity have made heredity a plausible mediating variable. 
Genetic influences upon SES and obesity may be exerted via inherited vulnerabilities to obesity that exist either in relative independence of the environment or in interaction with environmental factors. 
Evidence for genetic transmission of obesity and SES is derived from studies utilizing the Danish Adoption Register, which contains information about 4,500 adoptees, now middle-aged, who were separated from their biological parents very early in life. 
These studies have shown that the degree of fatness of adoptees is far more closely related to that of their biological parents than it is to that of their adoptive parents, indicating a measure of genetic transmission (Stunkard, S0rensen, et al., 1986). 
Other studies using this same register have found that the SES of adoptees is related to that of their adoptive parents, as expected, through social inheritance of SES (Teasdale & Sarenson, 1983). 
These studies also found that SES of adoptees is related to that of their biological parents, suggesting some measure of genetic transmission. 
This surprising finding was examined in a path analysis that revealed that genetics influenced SES through the mediation of intelligence, measured by IQ. Social transmission of SES, on the other hand, occurred primarily via the number of years of schooling provided by the adoptive parents. 
The simplest explanation of how genetic factors might mediate the effects of SES on obesity is that biological parents transmit to their offspring, along with their contribution to intelligence and therefore SES, some metabolic predisposition to obesity. 
A refinement of this explanation involves a gene-environment interaction. 
An illustration of how such a gene-environment interaction could occur is provided by a recent study of social class, food intake, and obesity in Parisian schoolchildren (Rolland-Cachera & Bellisle, 1986). 
This study demonstrated the previously mentioned paradox of the lack of correlation between energy intake and body weight of individuals and also showed an inverse relationship between SES and obesity. 
An explanation of these apparently contradictory findings begins with the observation that within each social class group, there was a comparable level of caloric intake, increasing as SES level declined. 
Despite this comparable level of caloric intake, within a given social class, some children were lean, some were of normal weight, and some were obese. 
In the lower social classes, however, in which the intake was 500 kcal greater than that in the upper SES, the prevalence of obesity was four times as great. 
It appears that at a given level of caloric intake, obesity will develop in metabolically predisposed persons who do not eat more than normal-weight persons of the same SES. 
In a social class with a higher caloric intake, however, the threshold for maintenance of a normal body weight of a larger number of these predisposed persons will be exceeded, and thus more of them will become obese. 
This model of gene-environment interaction combines both social and genetic perspectives in the understanding of the relationship of SES and obesity and can provide insights for further research. 
Conclusion The relationship between SES and obesity differs between developed and developing societies and, within developed societies, between men and women. 
In developing societies, obesity among men, women, and children is rare, presumably because of insufficient food and also possibly because of high levels of energy expenditure. 
In these societies, the prevalence of obesity increases with rising wealth and increasingly available food. 
In developed societies, by contrast, increasing SES is associated with a decreasing prevalence of obesity among women. 
A tempting explanation of this paradox is that similar forces— relatively abundant food with few normative constraints about body weight—promote obesity in upper SES women in developing societies and in lower SES women in developed societies, leading to a high prevalence of obesity in each. 
The inverse SES-obesity relationship is unique to women in developed societies. 
In these societies the relationship between SES and obesity among men and among children is complex and poorly understood. 
Attitudes toward obesity in developed and developing societies are one explanation of the association between SES and obesity. 
These attitudes are congruent with the more robust associations between SES and obesity: the positive evaluations of obesity by almost all people in developing societies and the negative values about obesity affecting women in developed societies. 
Mechanisms whereby the attitudes toward obesity and thinness among women in developed societies may find expression in the 270JEFFERY SOBAL AND ALBERT J. STUNKARD inverse relationship of SES with obesity include dietary restraint, increased physical activity, social mobility, and inheritance.
