1. Introduction Firms are increasingly looking for knowledge outside their organisational boundaries (Chesbrough, 2003a, 2006) and are developing more outward-looking strategic approaches to research and development to source at least some knowledge of potential value from the broader environment in which they operate. 
Vertical disintegration pressures (Langlois, 2003), modularisation and outsourcing (Prencipe et al., 2003; Sturgeon, 2002), the growth of specialised technology markets (Arora et al., 2001; Brusoni et al., 2001) and difﬁculties in appropriating internal investments in intangibles (Chesbrough, 2003b) would appear to have strengthened ﬁrms’ incentives to increase their reliance on external knowledge for innovation.

The importance of external knowledge has been discussed at length in the innovation literature, 3 but interest in open innovation (OI) has been growing very fast especially in the last few years (Gassmann, 2006; Dahlander and Gann, 2010; Huizingh, 2010). 
Crucially, however, most of the theoretical developments and empirical evidence relate to manufacturing businesses. 
This is surprising given the predominant role of the service sector in advanced economies. 
The available evidence shows that services are no less innovative than manufacturing ﬁrms, but might, in fact, innovate in different ways (Metcalfe and Miles, 2000; Tether, 2003, 2005). 
Some quantitative evidence exists that reveals the importance of external linkages for service ﬁrms’ innovative performance (Leiponen, 2005, 2012; Love and Mansury, 2007; Love et al., 2010) while the link between openness and the adoption of a service business model in manufacturing ﬁrms is also coming to the fore (Chesbrough, 2011). 
Despite these signiﬁcant contributions, however, studies that analyse OI in services are still scarce. 
Open service innovation is a relatively unexplored area of research where novel theoretical and empirical investigations can shed new light on the strategic search behaviours of ﬁrms. 
3 This is arguably one of the most important messages to emerge from the relatively long tradition of research on innovation systems (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993; Freeman, 1995; Malerba, 2004).

Res. 
Policy (2013), ARTICLE IN PRESS G Model RESPOL-2882; No. of Pages 14 2 A. Mina et al. / Research Policy xxx (2013) xxx– xxx In this paper, ﬁrstly we focus on business services, a segment of the service sector characterised by high growth, productivity and innovation rates (Rubalcaba and Kox, 2007). 
Business services are a diverse group of businesses which include IT support services, design, architecture and engineering consultancies, R&D services, advertising, marketing and other traditional professional services such as legal services and management consultancy. 
Amongst them we ﬁnd prominent examples of business models structured to search broadly for external knowledge and to leverage internally generated knowledge. 
IDEO is a well-known case of a company whose knowledgebrokering activities are key to its business model and a fundamental source of competitive advantage. 
Born as a product development company, IDEO now offers a much broader range of consulting services for applications as diverse as health and medical devices and services, energy, food and beverage, education, mobile and digital technologies, and innovation in the public sector. 
The company thrives on knowledge exchanges with clients, suppliers and the science base in the search for innovative solutions. 
4 Active intermediation between users and developers of new knowledge also characterises the operation, for example, of the technology consultancies that have greatly contributed to the growth of the Cambridge (UK) cluster, arguably the most successful technology cluster in Europe. 
Service companies such as Cambridge Consultants, the Technology Partnership (TTP), PA Technology and Sagentia engage in intense, and typically highly focused, interactions with their local and international clients and research base. 
5 But interactions between services and specialist external knowledge sources are found at the cutting edge in many different subsectors, including more traditional businesses such as restaurants. 
The Catalan restaurant El Bulli, named for several years amongst the world best restaurants and famed as a radical innovator in the sector, developed over time as one component of a broader platform of activities which included upstream collaborations with the science base as well as downstream interactions, amongst others, with food manufacturers and the hospitality sector. 
6 Interestingly, a service approach to business is not limited to subsectors of the economy that are classiﬁed as services in standard industry statistics. 
Services are also economic activities that can be performed by product-based businesses. 
Several manufacturing ﬁrms are signiﬁcantly expanding the range of services they provide in combination with their core products as a way to enhance value creation and customer retention opportunities. 
Companies such as IBM, Xerox, and Rolls Royce now derive growing shares of their total revenues from service activities, although they are not considered as service businesses, and they often develop their service proﬁle by partnering with external knowledge sources. 
In this paper we study the open innovation practices of business services and show to what extent and in what way these differ from those in manufacturing sectors. 
Secondly, we take into account the service offer of manufacturing ﬁrms and we explore the implications of adopting a service business model for the open innovation proﬁles of manufacturing ﬁrms. 
We analyse a unique dataset generated through an original survey of open innovation practices amongst UK ﬁrms conducted at the UK Innovation Research Centre in 2010. 
We ﬁnd that business services are more open users of external knowledge than manufacturers. 
We show that they are more intensive users of informal relative to formal open innovation practices than manufacturers. 
In addition, we uncover the importance of scientiﬁc knowledge vis-à-vis market knowledge in 4 Hargadon and Sutton (1997), Kelley and Littman (2001) and Hargadon (2003).

business services relative to manufacturing ﬁrms. 
When we consider the service activities of manufacturing ﬁrms we ﬁnd that a higher degree of openness, enabling the search and recombination of more diverse knowledge inputs, is associated with the adoption of a service inclusive business model. 
Finally, and consistently with our prior ﬁndings, we show that the degree of service integration is positively associated with engagement in informal knowledgeexchange activities. 
Overall, the paper contributes to the theory of open innovation by postulating new aspects of the sectoral and ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics of external knowledge searches. 
2. Exploring open service innovation: theory and evidence 2.1. 
How does service innovation differ from manufacturing? 
Traditional industrial economics and technologist approaches to innovation used to fundamentally underestimate the role, extent and effects of innovation in services (Metcalfe and Miles, 2000). 
The service sector is no longer seen as a technologically backward, ‘unprogressive’ and passive adopter of technology, but both theory development and empirical evidence on the dynamics of the service economy are still lagging behind manufacturing. 
The introduction of the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), where individual service sectors were included in the early 1990s, greatly contributed to the growth of scholarly work on services partly because it enabled the collection of observations on innovation that were not limited to R&D or patenting. 
A number of stylised facts distinguish service from manufacturing innovation. 
Quantitative analyses based on CIS data show for example that overall R&D plays a less important role in services, even though this does not hold true for all services (Evangelista, 2000; Tether, 2003). 
7 The traditional distinction between product and process innovations becomes weaker in a service context since services often consist of processes that are hardly separable from the outcomes they produce. 
In addition, service innovation tends to imply greater emphasis on organisational and human capital factors relative to more tangible assets (Gallouj and Savona, 2009; Sirilli and Evangelista, 1998; Hipp and Grupp, 2005). 
Service ﬁrms have been found to rely heavily on information and communication technologies and non-R&D innovation expenditures and seem to use more external knowledge sources than manufacturing (Cainelli et al., 2006; Tether and Tajar, 2008; Hipp, 2010). 
They also appear to collaborate more frequently with their customers and suppliers (Tether, 2005). 
There is some evidence that this practice has positive effects on ﬁrm innovation performance (Leiponen, 2005; Mansury and Love, 2008; Love et al., 2010). 
One striking feature of the service economy certainly is the variety existing between and within individual service sectors. 
This encompasses a broad range of activities with different characteristics (Miles, 2005; Tether, 2002; Rubalcaba and Kox, 2007), although some studies indicate that the degree of similarity between services and manufacturing increases with the level of knowledge-intensity, so that knowledge-intensive services (Leiponen, 2005; Love et al., 2011) will display innovation behaviours similar to those of hightechnology manufacturing ﬁrms (Hollenstein, 2003; Rodriguez and Ballesta, 2010). 
8 Yet, some uncertainties persist. There are, for example, conﬂicting results on the role of speciﬁc types of 7 With the exception of the recent paper by Leiponen (2012), who ﬁnds that R&D activities play a similar role in both service and manufacturing innovation. 
8 In a cluster analysis of the innovation activities of Finnish and Danish ﬁrms, Leiponen and Drejer (2007) show that the differences between manufacturing and service ﬁrms within clusters are a matter of degree as service ﬁrms do not tend to cluster together but alongside manufacturing ﬁrms.

Mina et al. / Research Policy xxx (2013) xxx– xxx 3 knowledge and collaboration partners and the need remains to deepen our understanding of whether the search for external knowledge may indeed have different drivers and present different characteristics across the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy. 
2.2. 
Open innovation in business services Business services are an extremely important component of the service economy (Rubalcaba and Kox, 2007) and are intensive traders of knowledge inputs (Metcalfe and Miles, 2000; den Hertog and Bilderbeek, 2000; Gallouj, 2002). 
They tend to add value by leveraging human capital, as opposed to physical capital, and display rates of innovation not inferior to manufacturing businesses, typically the highest recorded in the service sector (Tether and Tajar, 2008). 
They have been described in the literature as key innovation intermediaries, or ‘brokers’, that excel at connecting together innovative ideas developed by different individuals and organisations (Bessant and Rush, 1995; Hargadon and Sutton, 1997; Howells, 2006), and at translating new knowledge generated by the science base into commercialisable inputs (Tether and Tajar, 2008). 
The highly interactive and relational nature of their economic activities suggests that the open innovation model may be particularly important for these ﬁrms. 
Firms can choose between engaging in contractual arrangements as a formal framework for cooperation, or they can engage in informal exchanges. 
These include direct unstructured interaction with collaborators, participation in innovation networks, or sharing of un-codiﬁed know-how with other ﬁrms. 
In these types of activities collaboration tends to be based on mutual trust and moral obligations rather than legally binding contracts (Appleyard, 1996; Liebeskind et al., 1996; Van Aken and Weggeman, 2000). 
We therefore provide evidence on the choice between formal and informal governance mechanisms. 
These may differ between businesses services and manufacturing ﬁrms. 
We can expect, for example, that the intangible nature of services does not favour highly formalised contractual solutions (Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons, 2000). 
Instead, their interactive nature can give rise to relational solutions (Vargo et al., 2008), favouring informal over formal arrangements. 
Business services may also be more difﬁcult to control and monitor on delivery, given the intangibility, simultaneity and people-oriented character of many activities (Brouthers and Brouthers, 2003). 
Resource based theory suggests that the choice of partners for collaboration depends on their potential to provide additional complementary inputs (Miotti and Sachwald, 2003). 
On this basis the literature has distinguished between science-based and marketbased partners as sources of scientiﬁc/technical knowledge and market knowledge respectively (Danneels, 2002; Du et al., 2012). 
The order of preference with which ﬁrms might engage in open innovation activities is relevant also because the search for external knowledge is not costless. 
Firms make strategic decisions that explicitly or implicitly take into account the opportunity costs of any choice of partners relative to available alternatives. 
We therefore examine the important issue of the choice of type of open innovation partner. 
Engaging with market-based partners such as customers and suppliers can help to better specify the market requirement for innovated goods, services or processes and to spread the costs and risks of the innovation process. 
Interaction with customers, and the co-creation of the ﬁrm’s output with its customers, has been emphasised as the most important channel of information supporting the adoption of an open service innovation model (Chesbrough, 2011), while prior literature has highlighted the beneﬁts of interaction with lead users (von Hippel, 1976; Hagedoorn, 1993). 
Firms might, instead or in addition, engage in collaborative arrangements with universities and research institutions in order to gain access to basic knowledge, either to better exploit their existing capabilities across a wide range of functional management domains, including HR, ﬁnance and marketing (Hughes and Kitson, 2012), or to explore new avenues for innovation and growth (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2007; Veugelers and Cassiman, 2005). 
Furthermore, growing interactions with the public research base are compatible with the expectations that are placed in the management and policy literatures on the economic potential of ‘the entrepreneurial university’ (Etzkowitz, 2002; Audretsch and Phillips, 2007) and might have become easier over time through the implementation of policies aimed at facilitating access and simplifying negotiation processes (Perkmann and Walsh, 2007). 
Engaging with market-based partners can be especially useful for services by virtue of their intangible nature, their process-based business model and the often theorised co-production of their output with customers (Brouthers and Brouthers, 2003; Chesbrough, 2011; Miles, 2005). 
On the other hand, universities and public research institutes may be more suitable partners for manufacturing ﬁrms rather than services because they can extract the most value from their R&D activities whilst services will typically rely more on investments in human capital. Previous research based on CIS data has indeed found that providers of scientiﬁc knowledge are on average less important as a source of information for service innovators than for manufacturing innovators (Arundel et al., 2007; Tether, 2005). 
2.3. 
Open service innovation in manufacturing ﬁrms Firms are typically classiﬁed as being either in services or in manufacturing, but evidence is growing that service provision is becoming an increasingly important dimension of the offer of manufacturing ﬁrms, who are expanding the service component of their output (Chesbrough, 2011). 
Seen in this light, services are no longer the remit of specialist service providers, but become instead characteristics of a broader business model adopted by manufacturing ﬁrms to capture additional value or retain their customer base. 
It has been reported that the share of service sales is as high as 31% for an average manufacturing ﬁrm (Fang et al., 2008) while a recent survey of UK businesses has found that 80% of manufacturing ﬁrms are offering some type of services (Tether and BascavusogluMoreau, 2011). 
The growing literature on business model innovation (see for example Teece, 2010; Chesbrough, 2010; Gambardella and McGahan, 2010; Zott et al., 2011) emphasises the need to investigate how ﬁrms develop, deliver and appropriate value and how ﬁrms can change the architecture of their businesses to adapt to new environments, and sustain competitive advantages or generate extra proﬁts. 
Teece (2010) argues that changes in the ﬁrm’s organisational and ﬁnancial design aimed to improve the capability of ﬁrms to turn customer needs into proﬁts are at least as important as technological innovation. 
The integration of a service component into the ﬁrms’ range of activities can be a powerful mechanism of value creation (Wise and Baumgartner, 1999): advocates of ‘servitisation’ strategies argue that services enable manufacturers to get closer to their customers, enhancing understanding of users’ needs, strengthening relationships and increasing customer loyalty (Vandermerwe and Rada, 1988). 
The offer of complex bundles of products, processes and services, however, poses speciﬁc challenges to the organisation of the knowledge base of the ﬁrms. 
It is likely to demand the recombination of different resources (Kogut and Zander, 1992) including knowledge inputs, coming from different sources and this can push ﬁrms to intensify the search for external knowledge that may be necessary to sustain an integrated business model (Chesbrough, 2011). 
It is therefore important to explore whether the adoption of a service business model by manufacturing ﬁrms is associated with a higher degree of openness.

Policy (2013), ARTICLE IN PRESS G Model RESPOL-2882; No. of Pages 14 4 A. Mina et al. / Research Policy xxx (2013) xxx– xxx 3. Data and methods 3.1. 
The survey The data we use in this paper are drawn from the UK∼IRC Open Innovation Survey, speciﬁcally designed and launched in 2010 to study the open innovation practices of UK companies. 
The research team used systematic random sampling measures to draw a sample of 12,000 ﬁrms, with between 5 and 999 employees, from Bureau van Dijk’s FAME Database, which contains detailed ﬁnancial company-level information on UK and Irish businesses. 
The sampling proportions in terms of sector were 65% for manufacturing and 35% for services, plus two additional samples from the pharmaceuticals and clean energy sectors. 
After carrying out pilot tests in different size groups and sectors, 5 waves of questionnaires were sent out by post between June and November. 
9 1202 ﬁrms completed the survey, leading to a 10% response rate. 
To check for non-response bias, FAME Data were used again to compare respondents with non-respondents in terms of size, turnover, and year of ﬁrm formation. 
No signiﬁcant difference was found except for low-tech business services, where respondents had a signiﬁcantly smaller turnover than non-respondents (Cosh and Zhang, 2011). 
In the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), widely used in the majority of prior quantitative studies (Laursen and Salter, 2006; Leiponen and Helfat, 2010; Leiponen and Drejer, 2007; Leiponen, 2012; Tether, 2002, among others), ﬁrms are asked about the importance of different sources of information/cooperation for their innovation related activities. 
While also including these questions, the survey we use collected information on ﬁrms’ open innovation practices. 
Data on such activities are not obtained in the CIS datasets. 
The term ‘open innovation’ was not used anywhere in the survey in order to avoid potential respondent bias, but ﬁrms were speciﬁcally asked about the different types of informal and formal activities they had engaged in with external parties to accelerate innovation. 
Therefore, while comparable to the previous empirical literature, this paper uses a richer dataset to directly explore the ﬁrms’ open innovation activities and their antecedents. 
The sample size we use in this study varies between 788 and 819 across estimations, due to missing values. 
Exclusion because of missing values resulted in our ﬁnal sample having a slight overall bias towards more open ﬁrms, with higher R&D expenditures and human capital. However, and crucially for our purposes, there were no differences in this respect between our services and manufacturing subsamples and no other differences between our initial and ﬁnal samples. 
The latter shows a reasonable spread across industries with shares of manufacturing 67% (vs. 63% in the original sample) and services 33% (vs. 37% in the original sample). 
10 Table 1 displays the industry distribution of our sample. 
In keeping with prior studies we also report as descriptive statistics measures of the breadth and depth of open innovation across 9 For waves 1–3, the original 12-pages long questionnaire was sent out; then in order to increase the response rate, shorter versions were used in subsequent waves. 
10 We further explore the risk of response bias in our data by performing a wave analysis of responses. 
Those requiring more prompts may be hypothesised to be closer in characteristics to non-respondents than early respondents. 
Since our data were collected in ﬁve waves it is possible for us to test whether there are systematic differences in our variables across waves and whether these are associated with the timing of response. 
One-way ANOVA analyses and post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction revealed no signiﬁcant differences between survey waves in any of our open innovation variables. 
In line with the sample attrition tests already reported, multinomial logistic regressions of dependent and independent variables against the survey wave only revealed a signiﬁcant difference in human capital for waves four and ﬁve (but with discordant signs), and R&D expenditure for wave one. 
These tests conﬁrm that non-respondent bias is not a major cause for concern in our analyses. 
sectors. 
11 OI breadth is deﬁned as the number of open innovation activities ﬁrms engage in. OI depth is deﬁned as the extent to which ﬁrms make intensive use of the different activities. 
Overall, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms engage in four open innovation activities on average. 
R&D services (n = 50) exhibit a higher level of openness, as well as scoring OI activities as highly important, followed by chemicals and chemical products (n = 84), indicating that ﬁrms in knowledge intensive services and medium-high technology manufacturing are more engaged in open innovation activities. 
12 Although there is some variation within the business service sector, manufacturing ﬁrms are more heterogeneous in terms of the breadth and depth of openness. 
Given this heterogeneity, in what follows, we distinguish the high-tech manufacturing sub-sample within the whole sample of manufacturing businesses. 
3.2. 
Variables and descriptive statistics 3.2.1. 
Dependent variable The dependent variable in our study is the extent of ﬁrms’ OI activities. 
In the survey, ﬁrms were asked to indicate the degree of importance of various activities conducted with external parties in order to accelerate innovation. 
Our measures of open innovation are therefore based on qualitatively different and wider information than previous empirical studies of CIS survey data. 
The latter are based on observations of the importance of different partners (customers, suppliers, universities, etc.) as sources of external knowledge. 
We, instead, are able to observe the number, partners and type of open innovation activities performed by ﬁrms. 
The full list of 15 activities is reported in Appendix A (Table A1). 
These take into account both formal (contractual) and informal (noncontractual) activities. 
The importance of each activity is evaluated by means of a Likert Scale (0 = not used, to 3 = highly important). 
In the ﬁrst instance we measure the scope of open innovation activities by adding up the normalised scores for all activities and divide them by the total number of activities. 
13 Firms that did not engage in any activity get a score of 0. Firms with higher scores are considered to be more open. 
Hypothetically a score of 1 is given to ﬁrms that have engaged in all types of activities and that have scored those activities as highly important, although no such ﬁrm exists in our sample. 
The resulting open innovation variable has a high degree of internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84. 
In order to identify the ﬁrms’ preferences for formal or informal activities we then construct two separate measures for informal (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.68) and formal practices (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80). 
Table 2 presents the use of OI activities for the whole sample, as well as business services, manufacturing, and high-tech manufacturing sub-samples. 
14 The most widely used open innovation activity in our sample (both in the original and the ﬁnal sample) is engaging directly with lead users. 
61% of the ﬁrms in our ﬁnal sample reported to have engaged directly with lead users in the last three years, and 24% scored this engagement as highly important. 
This is followed by joint R&D activities (34% of the ﬁnal sample), sharing facilities (30%) and joint marketing/co-branding and 11 The concepts of breadth and depth have been widely used in the previous literature with regard to ﬁrms’ search activities (Laursen and Salter, 2006; Leiponen and Helfat, 2010, amongst others). 
12 As we prove in our econometric analyses and related robustness checks, the inclusion of these R&D services is not a source of bias for the results. 
13 To normalise the scores of each item we divide each score by 3 (maximum possible value) to bring the scores within a 0–1 range. 
14 The classiﬁcation of sectors is based on the most detailed information level available in the dataset and reﬂects the FAME standard classiﬁcation of ﬁrms. 
High-Tech manufacturing includes classes: 33.3, 32.1, 32.3, 33.1, 24.41, 33.2, 32.2, 30.02, 33.4, 35.3, 30.01, 24.42.

The least used open innovation practice is informally exchanging ideas, with only 16% of the ﬁrms in our ﬁnal sample reporting it. When we look at the differences between business services and manufacturing, descriptive statistics reveal that business services are more engaged in non-contractual open innovation activities than manufacturing ﬁrms. 
15 However, these differences disappear when we restrict our sample to high-tech manufacturing, with the exception of participating in or setting up innovation networks with other ﬁrms. 
Regarding contractual open innovation activities, we see that business services are more similar to high-tech manufacturers in their formal search activities, than to the whole manufacturing sample. 
High-tech manufacturing ﬁrms more often participate in joint R&D projects and joint university research, whereas business services ﬁrms seem to privilege jointmarketing/co-branding activities. 
16 We also look at the characteristics of ﬁrms depending on the relative importance of formal and informal OI activities they are engaged in. For descriptive purposes, we classify ﬁrms in four 15 t-Test results (not reported but available from the authors upon request) shows that these differences are statistically signiﬁcant at a 95 percent level. 
16 Based on t-tests (not reported, but available from the authors upon request) none of these differences between the two subsamples are statistically signiﬁcant. 
groups (Table 3): low informal/low formal activities (48.1% of ﬁrms), low informal/high formal activities (8%), high informal/low formal activities (10.8%), and high informal/high formal activities (12.3%). 170 ﬁrms in our sample do not engage in any open innovation activities. 
Although statistically different, the average ﬁrm size is rather similar amongst the different categories. 
The average ﬁrm age is around 21–23 years in all categories except the low formal/high informal group, where the average ﬁrm age is around 18 years, and this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant across categories. 
Younger ﬁrms are more likely to engage in informal OI activities. 
R&D expenditures and human capital vary considerably. 
As it is reasonable to expect, ﬁrms with relatively higher R&D expenditures and shares of highly skilled human capital belong to high informal/high formal category, followed by low informal/high formal (Table 3). 3.2.2. 
Independent variables Our estimations contain indicators for a broad set of ﬁrm characteristics, including indicators for the ﬁrm being a business service ﬁrm, the sources of knowledge, and the adoption of a service business model. 
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 4, again for the whole sample, business services, manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing sub-samples.

In order to test their effect on openness we use the score of the importance of ‘customers and users’ and the score of the importance of ‘universities, other higher education and research organizations’, as perceived by the ﬁrms. 
As expected, customers and users represent the most widely used knowledge sources, with 91% of our sample conﬁrming them as a source of information, and 31% scoring them as highly important. 
Meanwhile, only 45% of our sample report having used universities and higher education institutions as a source of information. 
These shares are very similar between manufacturing and business services sectors, although high-tech manufacturing ﬁrms show a higher score for both knowledge sources. 
In order to test for the effect on open innovation activities of the adoption of a service business model by manufacturing ﬁrms, we operationalise the service integration concept by using two indicators: the ﬁrst measures the share of services in the total revenue of the ﬁrm; the second measures the integration of a service component in the ﬁrm’s innovation output (the ‘innovation types’ used to construct this variable are listed in Appendix A, Table A2). 
17 The survey questionnaire asks about the percentage of ﬁrms’ total revenue accounted for goods, services and others. 
Overall, the share of product sales is around 63% and the share of services sales 33% on average. 
Indeed, we ﬁnd considerable heterogeneity at the subsector level. 
The share of service revenues accounts for 69% of total revenues in business services, whereas it accounts respectively for 10% and 15% of the total revenue in low-tech and high-tech manufacturing ﬁrms. 
18 17 Note that these innovation types encompass a broader set of characteristics that the CIS. 
This also explains the higher percentage of innovative ﬁrms in our sample relative to the latest available CIS survey results (2011). 
18 Low-tech manufacturing ﬁrms seem to rely more on service revenues than high-tech manufacturing ﬁrms. 
This may signal the kind of services offered by the manufacturing businesses: recent surveys have indicated that the most widely offered services by manufacturing ﬁrms are training, delivery, spare parts, customer helpdesks, and installation (Tether and Bascavusoglu-Moreau, 2011; Baines et al., 2009). 
We then take into account the composition of ﬁrms’ innovation output. 
The variable we construct ranges from 0 to 5, according to the number of different types of innovation launched in the last three years, conditional on having introduced new or significantly improved service product and/or new method to produce and deliver the service product. 
80% of our ﬁnal sample has been engaged in some kind of innovative activities, however only 8% report more than 4 types of innovation. 
Although a slightly higher share of manufacturers report innovation, we do not ﬁnd any statistical difference between the two sectors, either for the number of innovations, or for the complexity of innovation. 
We include in the estimations an indicator for R&D activities, measured as the logarithm of ﬁrms’ internal R&D expenditure and an indicator of human capital, measured by the percentage of employees with a ﬁrst and/or higher degree. 
Although business services and manufacturing as a whole display very similar levels of R&D expenditures, high-tech manufacturing ﬁrms are more R&D intensive, as expected. 
On the other hand, business services have the most highly trained human capital, as should also be expected. 
Firm size and age may affect openness; we thus include the logarithm of number of employees, and ﬁrm age and its square term to account for potential non-linearities. 
19 Overall, manufacturing ﬁrms are larger and older than business services. 
We also take into account a ﬁrms’ largest market in terms of its sales revenue and the intensity of competition as perceived by the ﬁrm. 
Firms in both sectors operate mainly at the national and international level (with respectively 46% and 44% of the ﬁrms), and the geographical distribution of their largest market does not differ signiﬁcantly between the sectors. 
The intensity of competition also shows a very similar pattern. 
Finally we test for the effectiveness of the IP appropriation regime. 
The ability to capture external knowledge ﬂows is conditioned by knowledge appropriation mechanisms, because ﬁrms 19 We also introduced this latter variable as categories of age (not reported), in order to assess any potential effect of a particular age group on engaging in open innovation activities. 
Results did not differ signiﬁcantly.

In addition, the effectiveness of IP protection can also reﬂect technological opportunities available to ﬁrms whose effects need to be taken into account in our estimation. 
The appropriability regime enters the regression at the sectoral level (SIC 2 digit). 
The survey asked ﬁrms about the importance of different methods to protect their innovations, using a Likert Scale (0 = not used, to 3 = highly important). 
Following Cassiman and Veugelers (2006), we measure the effectiveness of IP protection as the industry average of the ﬁrm-level scores of importance. 
On average, ﬁrms that engage in open innovation activities score both formal and informal methods of protection as more important, compared to ﬁrms that do not engage in open innovation. 
As expected, business service sectors exhibit a lower score of importance of IP protection compared to manufacturing sectors. 
3.3. 
Modelling and estimation strategy We conduct our empirical analyses by means of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimations. 
In order to evaluate the difference between business services and manufacturing sectors, we introduce a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the ﬁrm is a business service ﬁrm and 0 otherwise. 
By interacting key variables with the dummy variable, we are able to assess the speciﬁcity of our business service ﬁrms. 
We tested for multicolinearity by calculating the variance inﬂation factors (VIFs). 
The VIF values for all variables are well below the threshold criterion of 10, suggesting that there is no excessive multicolinearity in the data (Kleinbaum et al., 1988). 
The deﬁnition of variables and correlation table are reported in Appendix A (Tables A3 and A4). 
Because our data are self-reported and collected via a crosssectional research design through a single questionnaire, common method variance may cause systematic measurement error and bias the estimates. 
We performed Harman’s one-factor test to verify the risk of common method effect. 
The unrotated principal component factor analysis and the principal component analysis with varimax rotation revealed the presence of ﬁve distinct factors with eigenvalue greater than 1.0, rather than a single factor. 
The three factors together accounted for 73 percent of the total variance; the ﬁrst (largest) factor did not account for a majority of the variance (24%). 
Thus, no general factor is apparent and we conclude that our results are not affected by this problem.

* p < 0.10. ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.01. included, respectively, in models 3 and 5 as predictors of informal openness, and in Models 4 and 6 as predictors of formal openness. 
As shown in Table 5, ﬁrm size is positively related to openness, while the effects of age (also in its squared form), largest market of operation and the intensity of perceived competition are not signiﬁcant. 
R&D expenditures are closely associated with openness. 
Human capital is also signiﬁcantly associated in the baseline model, although the relationship is weaker. 
In the baseline model the IP Protection variable is not signiﬁcant. 
The lack of resources faced by smaller ﬁrms might incentivize the search for external knowledge. 
In addition, the greater ﬂexibility of SMEs in adapting to changing external environment might prove beneﬁcial for this set of activities. 
These baseline results are, however, broadly in line with prior ﬁndings that showed that among the ﬁrm-level characteristics associated with openness, cooperation tends to increase with the size and R&D intensity of the ﬁrm (Veugelers, 1997; Fritsch and Lukas, 2001; Negassi, 2004). 
On the basis of their larger resource base, larger ﬁrms face lower search and management costs and expect to beneﬁt more from collaborative agreements. 
Results from Model 2 clearly show that business services are more active seekers of external knowledge than manufacturing ﬁrms. 
Models 3 to 6 address the relationship between being a business services ﬁrm and engaging in informal and formal open innovation activities. 
First of all we observe that in the basic speciﬁcation for all ﬁrms (Models 3 and 4), effectiveness of IP protection is associated with formal open innovation activities (Model 4) and not with informal ones (Model 3). Firm size also seems to matter more for formal activities (Model 4). Models 5 and 6 conﬁrm that business services are more active seekers of both formal and informal external knowledge, but service businesses are relatively more engaged in informal open innovation activities (Model 3). The coefﬁcient of the business service dummy is higher in Model 3 compared to Model 4, and signiﬁcant at 99% (compared to 95%). 
20 We then consider the role of market-based partners compared to science-based partners. 
In Table 6, Models 1 and 2 show that the importance of both market-based and science-based knowledge is positively associated with open innovation activities. 
For both informal and formal activities, however, science-based partners are more important than market-based partners. 
Moreover, market-based partners do not seem to be a more important source of knowledge for business service ﬁrms, as the interaction term is statistically not signiﬁcant (Models 3 and 4). Furthermore, we ﬁnd that science-based partners are a more important source of external knowledge as far as informal open innovation activities are concerned (Model 5), whereas there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference between business services and manufacturing ﬁrms with regards to formal open innovation activities. 
Contrary to expectations, business services are attracted by informal sciencebased collaborators more than manufacturing (as well as high-tech 20 As a robustness check we also interacted the R&D variable with the business service dummy to rule out the possibility that the association between business services and openness may be an artefact of R&D intensity rather than due to the characteristics of services ﬁrms. 
The interaction term was not statistically signiﬁcant, conﬁrming our ﬁndings.

Corroborating evidence is emerging that services ﬁrms can beneﬁt from the diversity of external knowledge ﬂows as much as manufacturing ﬁrms (Leiponen, 2012). 
This may indicate that in an advanced service economy ﬁrms increasingly seek basic knowledge as a source of competitive advantage and tend to do so informally rather than formally. 
With regards to the relationship between open innovation and service integration amongst manufacturing businesses, we ﬁnd strong evidence that the adoption of a service business model is positively related to ﬁrm openness. 
This may relate to the need to gather and recombine different knowledge inputs acquired through a broader set of search activities (Table 7: Models 3 and 4). The inclusion of a service element in the ﬁrm’s offer is positively and signiﬁcantly associated with openness. 
But the clearest evidence is found for our measure of service integration in the ﬁrm’s innovative output. 
In line with our ﬁnding on the service businesses’ relative preference for informal knowledge exchange mechanisms (Models 5 and 6), we also show that adoption of a service business model in product-based ﬁrms is more closely associated with their engagement in informal practices compared to formal ones. 
This provides further evidence of the strong link existing between the integration of service activities in manufacturing businesses and the characteristics of open service innovation. 
21 Table A6 in Appendix A shows that these results hold when we restrict the comparison to business services and high-tech manufacturing ﬁrms. 
4.1. 
Robustness checks We performed several robustness checks. 
22 Firstly, we tested the robustness of our results to the choice of the econometric speciﬁcation. 
As our dependent variable has values ranging between 0 and 1, we can treat it as a double censored dependent variable and run estimations using Tobit (Greene, 2000), or we can treat it as a proportional dependent variable and use a fractional logit model (Papke and Wooldridge, 1996). 
The results of these two estimation methods are very similar to the results shown in the paper. 
In the interest of clarity, and given the complexities associated with the interpretation of interaction terms in non-linear models, we present and discuss the OLS model. 
The second robustness check focused on the dependent variable. 
We computed a breadth measure for open innovation, similar in construction to the one used in well-known prior studies (Laursen and Salter, 2006; Leiponen and Helfat, 2010; Leiponen, 2012), but different in its components, which are our activities-based measures rather than measures based on knowledge sources. 
The results obtained with this new dependent variable are very similar to our main results. 
Final robustness checks have been performed by removing the R&D services sector from our sample to test whether our ﬁndings are unduly affected by the presence and characteristics of these businesses (e.g. high R&D expenditures). 
As expected since these factors are always systematically controlled 22 These are all available from the authors upon request. Please cite this article in press as: Mina, A., et al., Open service innovation and the ﬁrm’s search for external knowledge. 
Res. 
Policy (2013), ARTICLE IN PRESS G Model RESPOL-2882; No. of Pages 14 10 A. Mina et al. / Research Policy xxx (2013) xxx– xxx for in our prior estimations, there are no major changes in the main ﬁndings. 
23 Results hold also when we exclude from the sample the top quartile of the distribution of ﬁrms by R&D spending. 
5. Discussion and conclusion Successful innovation is increasingly dependent on the effective recombination of knowledge inputs across ﬁrm boundaries. 
Inter-ﬁrm knowledge ﬂows have the potential to improve the ﬁrm’s existing output or production processes, for example, by disclosing knowledge to partners, users or suppliers and incorporating valuable feedback (Henkel, 2006); or they can generate direct returns from underutilised intangible resources that can be traded on technology markets (Arora et al., 2001; Fosfuri, 2006). 
There are, however, important differences across sectors of the economy in the extent to and the way in which ﬁrms use open innovation strategies to gain or maintain competitive advantages and these differences have important implications for the strategic use of external knowledge sources. 
In this paper we extend our theoretical understanding of the open innovation model to take into account macro-sectoral speciﬁcities. 
In particular, we make a substantial contribution to the development of an emergent research programme on open service innovation (Chesbrough, 2011). 
Firstly, we do so by focusing on business services, where access, use and exchange of knowledge play a key role in value creation. 
Secondly, we consider the adoption of a service business model by manufacturing ﬁrms and look at its association with the degree of openness of ﬁrms. 
Existing analyses of innovation survey data have revealed that there is considerable variation in the way in which different sectors innovate. 
Typically, studies based on the CIS work with the observation of how many and what types of collaborators/sources ﬁrms use. 
However, they cannot address the questions which our data can of what open innovation activities they engage in, to what extent and in what way. 
As to the empirical evidence that is available on the open innovation paradigm, the number of case studies on the topic has been growing considerably, but these typically focus on manufacturing ﬁrms, with an emphasis on large companies in high-tech sectors. 
Only recent contributions (Love et al., 2010, 2011; Chesbrough, 2011) constitute rare exceptions that help redirect the necessary attention to services, a fundamental component of advanced economies by both value added and employment. 
From a methodological viewpoint, this study provides novel quantitative evidence which is an essential complement to the emergent case study work on open service innovation. 
Furthermore, our evidence is comparative and we are able to look at the same time at the characteristics of manufacturing and business service sectors, and then also focus on the product vs. service output of ﬁrms. 
The study has, of course, limitations. 
It is an intensive study of services – business services – characterised by high innovation rates. 
This choice is appropriate because these ﬁrms are arguably the most active open service innovators. 
This does not mean that traditional services cannot and should not derive considerable advantages from the adoption of open innovation solutions, but these are very unlikely to be the same solutions adopted, for example, by R&D-intensive ﬁrms. 
Secondly, the study is based 23 The R&D service sector plays an important role in open innovation, and may present analytical challenges in a comparative setting. 
The exclusion of our R&D service ﬁrms (n = 50) from our sample does not, however, fundamentally change the story. 
The only notable difference is a lack of association between the business service dummy and formal OI practices and a signiﬁcant effect in the interaction between market-based knowledge and the business service dummy, as we would expect. 
Importantly, business services remain more active open innovators, more engaged in non-contractual practices, and with a preference for informal collaborations with the university baserelative to manufacturing ﬁrms. 
on cross-sectional data, an aspect which cautions against making strong claims on causality without the assistance of panel data. 
But despite these limitations, this study provides a unique opportunity to observe the conduct of open innovation activities in a fairly large sample of businesses. 
It includes novel and original evidence on an important characteristic of advanced economies: their service proﬁle. 
Finally, its results are robust to different speciﬁcations of both our dependent variable and estimation technique. 
Among the ﬁrm-level characteristics associated with openness, our results conﬁrm that cooperation tends to increase with R&D intensity (Fritsch and Lukas, 2001; Negassi, 2004; Veugelers, 1997). 
Human capital intensity is also positively associated with openness, as expected by both innovation theory and resource-based perspectives. 
Effectiveness of IP protection is positively associated with formal, but not informal, open innovation practices. 
The relational nature of services is reﬂected in their higher degree of openness relative to manufacturing ﬁrms, with a preference for informal over formal practices relative to manufacturers. 
The literature on services often emphasises interactions, or co-creation of output, with customers (Bettencourt et al., 2002; Vargo et al., 2008). 
Interestingly, however, we ﬁnd that although customers remain a very important source of knowledge, as far as innovation is concerned and on a comparative basis, business services seem to be sensitive to potentially higher marginal beneﬁts generated from engaging with universities and the public research base. 
Compared to prior empirical studies, our results might indicate a development over time in the patterns of collaboration of UK ﬁrms. 
On the one hand, this may be facilitated by the growing institutional expectation that universities improve the impact of their research by intensifying their collaboration with industry. 
On the other hand, this may reﬂect the dynamism of a sector that is among the most productive and internationally competitive of the whole UK economy. 
Or to look at this from a different angle, the importance of interactions with customers may still be under-emphasised in analyses of manufacturing sectors where market knowledge could be more important because manufacturing innovation may be, on average, more expensive and errors more costly. 
24 In any event our ﬁndings suggest that further theoretical work on the purpose and nature of activities with different partners is a potentially fruitful area for research. 
So too is the nature of the link between open innovation activities and the choice between informal and formal modes of mediating such activities. 
They also suggest that new theorising is required on the form and nature of the knowledge exchanges ﬁrms may undertake with the science base, with possible extensions of conceptual models that are not limited to purely technological and scientiﬁc knowledge (Hughes and Kitson, 2012). 
When we consider services as economic activities instead of groups of ﬁrms identiﬁed by standard industry classiﬁcations, the data are consistent with the view that manufacturing ﬁrms are also part of the service economy. 
In line with Chesbrough (2011) we ﬁnd that in manufacturing businesses open innovation practices are associated with the adoption of a service business model, as indicated by service sales revenues and the integration of a service component in the ﬁrm’s innovation output. 
The more complex the innovation, and the broader the knowledge input that is required, the more likely that ﬁrms will seek external knowledge (Bayona et al., 2001; Piga and Vivarelli, 2004; Tether, 2002). 
These ﬁndings are also compatible with the view that service innovation tends to be recombinative or ‘architectural’ rather than purely technological in nature (De Vries, 2006). 
In addition, and consistently with our prior ﬁnding, the association of service integration amongst manufacturing businesses is stronger with the degree of 24 We thank an anonymous referee for this observation.

Of course, an important question remains as to whether openness translates into superior market performance and whether, where and under what circumstances in the service economy. 
This analysis is outside the scope of this contribution. 
It is of course a primary avenue for further research, but one that cannot be undertaken without an in-depth understanding of the ex ante distribution of open innovation behaviours across ﬁrms. 
Our ﬁndings provide solid foundations for further reconceptualisations of open innovation in service businesses and for new analyses of the changing boundaries of the ﬁrm in the service economy.
