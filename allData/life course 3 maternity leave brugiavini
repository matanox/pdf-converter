1. Introduction Economic theory suggests that, because of the specialization effect, the responsibility for childcare falls on women hence reducing their labour supply (Becker, 1985). 
As a result mothers are more likely to experience gaps in their career or even leave the labour market for good. 
The provision of maternity leave beneﬁts and their design is the crucial policy instrument a government can use in order to reduce gender differences in the labour market due to fertility and childcare. 
Maternity leave legislation affects most dimensions of labour market experience of women after maternity, i.e. wage level and growth, career prospects, labour market attachment, employability, and so on. Nevertheless the direct target of the legislation is the period immediately after or around childbearing: whether new mothers are given the right to take a period of leave from work and the possibility to return to the same job at the same conditions afterwards, and whether they are given some income support during maternity leave. 
This is the reason why we focus our attention on the effect of maternity leave schemes on the length of job interruption at each maternity over the lifecycle: any effect on other labour market outcomes is mediated by the time spent at home for child caring. 
The present paper contributes to the literature in two ways: ﬁrst, we are able to split job interruptions after childbearing into period in which women are employed but not at work, and periods in which they are out of labour force. 
Our main result is that more generous maternity leave schemes induce women to lengthen the periods protected by maternity leave schemes and to shorten periods spent out of labour force. 
The second contribution comes from the cross-country nature of the data at hand. 
Women decisions about job interruptions at childbearing depend on maternity leave policies but are also inﬂuenced by cultural factors: the sociological literature has paid A R T I C L E I N F O Article history: Received 21 May 2012 Received in revised form 16 October 2012 Accepted 22 October 2012 JEL classiﬁcation: C31, J13, J22 Keywords: Maternity leave Job continuity Female labour supply A B S T R A C T Maternity leave policies have important effects on several labour market outcomes of women, and are speciﬁcally designed to reduce gender differences in the various dimensions of working life and to contrast the negative consequence of fertility decisions. 
By making use of a unique data set which contains complete work and fertility histories for different European countries, combined with features of maternity leave schemes across countries and over time, we look at the effect of maternity leave beneﬁts on job interruptions after each successive childbirth. 
The main result of the paper is that maternity leave legislation in Europe effectively increases job protection and female labour market attachment: a more generous paid maternity leave increases the number of weeks employed but not at work, but reduces the number of weeks spent out of the labour market.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2012.10.003 particular attention to the effect of gender role and family attitudes as well as work values on women’s labour market participation (see for example Thornton, Alwin, & Camburn, 1983; Kiecolt & Acock, 1988; Burt & Scott, 2002). 
In order to account for both, we use the third wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), known as SHARELIFE, which is a retrospective survey where a representative sample of the 50+ population of thirteen European countries reports their complete life histories, with details about each employment and maternity episode. 
Individual data are then matched by year and country to the maternity leave legislation information available through the ‘‘Comparative Maternity, Parental, and Childcare Leave and Beneﬁts Database’’ (Gauthier, 2011). 
With these data we have enough variation in policies and cultural traits along time and across countries to retrieve relevant policy implications. 
From that perspective, our analysis suggests that maternity leave policies seems to effectively target the objective they are designed for, since they increase female labour market attachment. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the recent literature on maternity leave and more speciﬁcally on job interruption at childbirth. 
Section 3 describes SHARELIFE data while Section 4 illustrates the characteristics of maternity leave provisions across Europe and the policy database we use. 
Section 5 details the estimation strategy, while empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 offers a discussion on limitations and policy implications of the analysis. 
2. Literature review Several authors addressed the life-cycle joint decisions of labour supply and fertility: in some cases fully ﬂedged dynamic stochastic models have been developed (see for example Adda, Dustmann, & Stevens, 2011; Attanasio, Low, & Sanchez, 2008; Del Boca & Sauer, 2009), in other cases a ‘‘reduced form’’ approach has been followed (e.g. 
Del Boca, Pronzato, & Pasqua, 2009; Han, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2009; Ruhm, 1998). 
Finally, changes in policies have been exploited to study the effects of maternity leave on labour market outcomes (Klerman & Leibowitz, 1997, 1999; Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2011). 
The determinants of women’s decisions about education, family formation, fertility and labour market participation have been a long standing focus also in the sociological literature. 
Gender role and family attitudes have been proven to have strong consequences for labour market outcomes, as well as for fertility. 
Thornton et al. (1983) found that these attitudes are developed at young age and are strongly affected by parental education and religious afﬁliation. 
Other authors (see Burt & Scott, 2002; Kiecolt & Acock, 1988) found that the presence of a working mother during adolescence inﬂuences gender role attitudes towards a more egalitarian view. 
More recently, Kreyenfeld (2010), using the German SocioEconomic panel, provides evidence of postponement of parenthood due to uncertainty on job career: women who feel more unsecure about their job and their career prospects tend to postpone the ﬁrst child birth. 
Klerman and Leibowitz (1997) provide a simple framework to analyse the effect of the introduction of unpaid maternity leave in the labour market (starting from a situation where maternity provisions are completely missin g). The model they propose departs from a standard spot labour market model for women and acknowledges the existence of enduring employment relations. 
In such a market when a woman decides to stay away from work she has to quit her job losing ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital and bearing the costs of searching for a new job. 
The net present value of future earnings, quitting and re-entering the job-market, is likely to be lower than what the women would have realized without interruptions. 
Child care has a positive marginal effect on mothers’ utility, therefore women are willing to have children and experience a period out of the labour force. 
As children grow old, the utility from childcare falls and the shadow price of leisure raises inducing mothers to search again for a job. 
Tastes for childcare and expected wage offered after childbearing determine the length of interruption. 
Unpaid maternity leave offers new mothers the opportunity to exit the labour force for a given period of time and return to the labour market at the same wage they were paid before interruption. 
The implication of Klerman and Leibowitz model is that the effect of unpaid maternity leave on the extensive margin, i.e. on the probability of experiencing a job interruption at childbearing, is unambiguous: the introduction of maternity leave can induce some women, which would otherwise have worked continuously, to leave the labour market for a certain period. 
By contrast, the effect of unpaid leave on the intensive margin (i.e. the length of interruption), is ambiguous and it depends on tastes for child caring and labour market opportunities. 
This is clear in a comparative statics framework: a fraction of women with high tastes for child caring without maternity leave would have a long interruption. 
The introduction of maternity leave increases wage after maternity if the interruption is shortened to a given threshold. 
The shadow price of leisure over and above such a threshold increases above the reservation wage, thus inducing those women to reduce the length of job interruption. 
On the other hand, women with low tastes for child caring or with higher human capital without maternity leave would not quit job at maternity, or would stay out of labour force for a very limited period. 
The introduction of maternity leave reduces the cost of job interruptions shorter than the maximum length set by the policy. 
Therefore, shadow price of leisure for period shorter than the statutory length declines, inducing women with low tastes for child caring to lengthen their interruption. 
The empirical evidence on the effect of unpaid maternity leave points to a moderate impact on labour supply: Klerman and Leibowitz (1997) ﬁnd no statistical evidence of an effect on length of the interruption, and the same authors in a second paper (1999) ﬁnd no effect of the legislation on the probability of changing employer before and after maternity-leave. 
Han and Waldfogel (2003) also analyse the introduction of unpaid maternity leave in US at the beginning of the 90s by making use of a different data source. 
They conclude unpaid maternity leaves have limited impact on leave-taking, and point to the potential importance of paid maternity leave. 
Modern European welfare states provide paid maternity leave schemes since at least the mid 60s. 
From a modelling point of view there are no substantial differences between unpaid and paid maternity leave: a paid leave increases the income effect of the policy, in other words it is equivalent to an increase in the present value of the stream of earnings after childbearing. 
Rossin-Slater et al. (2011) analysed data from California where paid leave was introduced in 2004, and their conclusion is that moving from unpaid to paid maternity leave doubled the length of job interruption from three to six-seven weeks. 
While evidence on moving from unpaid to paid maternity leave is clear, results are mixed when a paid leave policy is changed to make it more generous. 
Pronzato (2009) using cross country data from Europe ﬁnds that longer statutory maternity leave leads to shorter interruption and higher employment rates after childbirth, at least after the ﬁrst year post child birth. 
Rønsen and Sundstro¨m (1996) ﬁnd a similar result using data from Sweden and Norway, but in a later paper (2002) they ﬁnd the opposite effect: longer institutional leave leads to longer interruptions. 
Gustafsson, Wetzels, Vlasblom, and Dex (1996) and Bergemann and Riphahn (2010) use different estimation approaches, but both separate the effect of length of maternity leave and generosity of the beneﬁt. 
Their results are coherent: both the papers suggest that longer periods of paid leave increase the length of job interruptions, while more generous beneﬁts shorten the time spent out of labour market. 
By and large, both theoretical models and empirical studies have ambiguous implications about the effect of maternity leave policies on the length of job interruptions. 
Moreover, distinct features of different policies, and in particular the length of paid leave and the amount of the beneﬁt, seem to have different effects on the time spent out of the job market. 
As we stated in the introduction, we contribute to this literature studying the effect of maternity leave schemes on job interruptions dividing periods spent in employment but not at work and periods out of labour force. 
Finally, life-cycle models that account for fertility (see for example Del Boca & Sauer, 2009) highlight the importance of state dependence in maternity-related labour supply decisions: women tend to postpone maternities and to reduce the number of children in order to reduce the transitions in and out of the labour market. 
Troske and Voicu (2009) report the extensive literature on timing of the ﬁrst birth and the spacing of subsequent births, and point to the different probability of employment after each maternity episode. 
It is therefore reasonable to expect different effects of maternity leave policies at each subsequent childbirth. 
All in all, both the sociological and the economic literature point to the need for cross country data, covering different policies and accounting for different cultural attitudes towards gender roles and fertility decisions in order to carry out an insightful analysis. 
This is the reason why we resort to a Europe-wide dataset covering entire women job careers and fertility histories. 
3. The SHARELIFE data and descriptive evidence SHARELIFE is the third wave of data collection for SHARE, which focuses on people’s life histories. 
Almost 30,000 men and women across 13 European countries took part in this round of the survey. 
1 The respondents are representative for the European population aged 50 and over in Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden), Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and The Netherlands), the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece), as well as two transition countries (the Czech Republic and Poland). 
The SHARELIFE questionnaire covers several important areas of respondents’ lives, ranging from housing to detailed questions on health and health care. 
SHARELIFE is particularly suitable for our investigation since it provides complete working and maternity histories. 
Our analysis concentrates on Western European countries, i.e. we will not consider the Czech Republic and Poland, since women in Socialist countries were included in a system of full, but not freely chosen, employment (Gal & Kligman, 2000): women’s decisions concerning job interruptions at maternity would not be comparable to the behaviour of women in Western countries. 
For the same reason, we exclude women who were living in the DDR before 1989. 
2 SHARELIFE contains information on 12,540 women from the 11 countries we consider: 10,382 women had at least one job and, among them, 9022 had at least one child. 
About 47% of these women (4227) are retired in 2008– 2009, while the other half is still working, disabled, unemployed or out of the labour force. 
Looking at the subsample of women who were working at the time of motherhood, we focus on a selected group of the population. 
As an example, only 6718 women were working at the time of ﬁrst childbirth. 
Moreover, the labour market participation rate of women at the time of childbirth is indeed very heterogeneous across countries (see Table 1). While in most countries the labour market participation rate of women is above 60% in some countries, such as Italy and Spain, the percentage of women working at the time of childbirth is very low (between 25 and 40%).

The SHARE data collection has been primarily funded by the European Commission through the 5th framework programme (project QLK6-CT-2001-00360 in the thematic programme Quality of Life), through the 6th framework programme (projects SHARE-I3, RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE, CIT5CT-2005-028857, and SHARELIFE, CIT4-CT-2006-028812) and through the 7th framework programme (SHARE-PREP, 211909 and SHARE-LEAP, 227822).

2 Before 1990 in Eastern countries, gender equality deﬁned as equal labour-force participation of women and men was an important principle of public policy making. 
The system of family beneﬁt was created in order to support high employment rates for women; social beneﬁt, including family allowance and access to childcare, were linked to labour force attachment (Ola`h & Sz Fratczak, 2004). 
As a consequence, employment relations were completely different from Western countries. 
A. Brugiavini et al. / Advances in Life Course Research 18 (2013) 46–6748 In SHARELIFE, for each maternity episode, respondents are asked to report if they continued working without interruption, stopped working temporarily or left the labour market and never worked again. 
Women who stopped working temporarily are asked how long this interruption was (one month or less, one to three months, three to six months, six month to a year, 1 to three years or more than 3 years). 
Moreover, the dataset contains the year in which each job started and ﬁnished: we are then able to determine the employment status of each mother during the whole interruption at each child birth. 
Some women took a period of leave and returned to the same job afterwards, i.e. they were employed but not at work throughout the whole child caring period (we deﬁne these periods as maternities ‘‘in job’’); others left their job at the time of childbirth and returned later to a different occupation (maternities ‘‘out of job’’); ﬁnally, a group of women experienced a combination of both: a ﬁrst period employed but not at work followed by a period out of the labour force. 
Table 2 reports statistics on the distribution of those types of interruptions at maternity by country and time period, over the sample of birth episodes. 
There is a high degree of heterogeneity across countries and along time in the type of job interruptions at childbirth, however we can identify a few consistent patterns across countries. 
First of all, the fraction of women who spent the whole maternity leave employed but offwork (column 1) increased in all countries but for Greece. 
Such a pattern is clear in Northern Europe, but it is observable also in Central and Southern European countries. 
At the same time, the fraction of women who spent the entire period of job interruption out of the labour force (column 2) decreased, thus pointing to a substitution between the two types of interruptions. 
The fraction of childbirths in which the mother experienced both a period ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’ is below 10% of the sample, while the fraction of childbirths associated to zero interruptions (column 4) declined steadily in every country (again, Greece is an exception). 
As regards the length of the interruption, on average maternities ‘‘in job’’ are much shorter than the ones ‘‘out of job’’. 
Presumably, in the latter case average lengths are driven by those childbirths that lead to dropping out of the labour force for good: a childbirth where the mother resigned from her job at childbirth and never worked again is associated to an ‘‘out of job’’ spell lasting from the time of childbirth until retirement. 
3 In Table A1 in Appendix we repeat the same descriptive analysis excluding ‘‘drop off’’ maternities: the sample size reduces from 14,921 childbirths to 12,272, ‘‘out of job’’ lengths turn comparable to ‘‘in job’’ ones, while there are no substantial changes in terms of distribution Table 1 Women working prior to each childbirth.

Brugiavini et al. / Advances in Life Course Research 18 (2013) 46–67 50 among types of childbirth episodes (i.e. columns 1–4 of Table 2). As regards the evolution of length of interruptions along time, there seems to be a clear pattern only in Scandinavian countries: in Sweden and Denmark ‘‘in job’’ spells are substantially longer after 1980 while the ‘‘out of job’’ ones are shorter. 
The main insight from Table 2 is that there seems to be an increasing labour market attachment at the time of childbirth for younger cohorts. 
This is consistent with the rising labour market attachment of women in recent decades. 
The observed trend is due both to important cultural changes, and to an increasingly protective welfare state which helped mothers to cope with working and family life. 
In order to isolate the second channel and estimate the role of maternity leave polices, we supplement SHARELIFE with an historical policy database. 
4. Maternity leave provisions across Europe Policies aiming at supporting mothers in the period before, during, and immediately after childbirth in which mothers take a leave from work are now common in most European (and OECD) countries, and can be traced back to the beginning of the XX century. 
4 At that time, the main concern was the protection of the health of the child and mother: they were characterized by compulsory pre and post natal leave, while income support and job protection were typically not included. 
The paternalistic rationale behind early policies was even more explicit in the post World War II period, when the main goal of family policies was to restore the position of women to their ‘‘proper’’ roles of mothers and wives (Frank & Lipner, 1988). 
The approach changed completely at the end of the 1960s: maternity leave policies evolved from a restriction on the employment of women during the period of childbirth to a job-protected time off-work to care for newborns and young children (Ruhm, 1998). 
In order to identify the direct effect of maternity leave policies on the time spent off work and on labour market attachment during these interruptions, we supplement SHARELIFE with the key characteristics of legislation regarding maternity leave in the Western European countries considered in the present paper, over a 50 years span. 
Our policies data are taken from Gauthier (2011): this is the third version of a database collecting key features of maternity, parental and childcare leave schemes in OECD countries, and spans the period 1960–2010. 
It is considered to be the most comprehensive data collection on historical trends in family policy regulations in developed welfare states. 
Collecting reliable and comparable indicators about maternity leave over a long period and a large group of countries is not an easy task since the distinction between different (but related) policies can be quite blurred: Gauthier (2011) acknowledges the fact that there is considerable inconsistency in the literature regarding how maternity, parental and childcare are deﬁned and distinguished. 
We follow her approach and deﬁne maternity leave as the leave granted to mothers in connection with childbirth, and which usually includes a period of leave prior and after childbirth. 
This is a rather restrictive deﬁnition: we exclude parental leave which refers to the leave options after the maternity protection period, and is available both to mothers and fathers. 
5 We choose this approach for two reasons: ﬁrst, this allows us to be consistent with a well established data source. 
Second, the features of parental leave are so diverse across countries and over time that reducing them to a limited set of variables entails a number of assumptions we are not willing to make in order not to jeopardize the robustness of our results. 
Table 3 reports the minimum, maximum and mean duration in weeks and amount of the beneﬁt as a percentage of wages in the manufacturing sector of maternity leave schemes across countries and in two different time periods, i.e. 1960–1979 and 1980–2010. 
Moreover, the table reports the same statistics for the number of weeks of full wage leave, which is a synthetic indicator of the generosity of maternity leaves used by Ruhm (1998) with aggregate data, which is obtained multiplying the previous two measures. 
Maternity leave duration varies widely along time and across countries, from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 68.6 weeks. 
On the contrary generosity did not change much over time: maternity leave schemes typically provide income support, at least for a portion of the leave from work, and the replacement rate often exceeds 80%. 
6 In the last decades, the overall trend has been towards more generous beneﬁts: this is clear looking at the time trend of full wage weeks of maternity leave. 
5. Estimation strategy SHARELIFE records relevant events of individuals’ lives along a timeline: there are years in which individuals may have experienced many important events, such as a new job, the birth of a child, changing housing accommodation. 
In other years no relevant event took place, and therefore there would be no record in the survey for that individual in that particular year. 
Given this structure, we could in principle think to our data set as a ‘‘retrospective panel’’, however we cannot trace back all the ‘‘year-to-year’’ changes as if these were proper transitions. 
Moreover the birth of a child is a relatively ‘‘rare event’’ in the life of a woman, so that we would ﬁnd ourselves with many years where all the relevant variables are missing. 
For these reasons we construct a data-set of birth episodes, which is merged by year and country to the policies database by Gauthier (2011) described in previous section. 
Note that this way we are forced to drop all birth episodes prior to 4 The German Imperial Industrial Code in 1891 and following amendments (1903 and 1911) supplied women with a maternity leave period after childbirth and paid time off work in the two weeks before delivery (Ruhm, 1998). 
5 The only exception is Sweden, where in 1974 the maternity leave scheme was completely replaced by parental leave. 
6 Switzerland is the most notable exception. 
Note that while in the (Gauthier, 2011) data the beneﬁt as a percentage of manufacturing wage is set to 0, the Swiss scheme includes a ﬂat rate beneﬁt, though quite small, since 1958. 
1960 in the analysis: out of 14,921 births, we drop the earlier 2174 ones. 
7 The aim of the empirical exercise is to estimate the effect of maternity leave schemes on time spent off work at child birth, distinguishing between weeks spent off-work ‘‘in job’’, i.e. keeping the same occupation, and weeks spent off-work ‘‘out of job’’, i.e. quitting the occupation and exiting the labour force. 
Moreover, as stressed among others by Del Boca and Sauer (2009) and Troske and Voicu (2009), decisions regarding time off work of women who give birth to more than one child in their lifetime may be different: they are at different stages of their career, they have the past experience of previous maternities, and legislation may have changed. 
Therefore decisions about ﬁrst, second and third job interruptions at child birth must be treated separately, acknowledging the dependence of each episode on the previous ones. 
We estimate a system of six equations, where the dependent variables are weeks ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’ at the ﬁrst, second and third childbirth. 
8 Formally, we estimate the following system: This is a triangular system, where weeks off work at childbirth t, both ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’, depend on weeks off work at previous child births. 
This way we fully acknowledge the importance of state dependence, i.e. the fact that timing and spacing of each childbirth inﬂuence the decision about the successive ones. 
X mat contains the covariates of interest: in our preferred speciﬁcation the number of full wage weeks of maternity leave, in a second estimation the duration and generosity of maternity leave at the moment of each child birth in the country of residence of the mother as in Gustafsson et al. (1996), in a third speciﬁcation only the length of maternity leave. 
Both the key explanatory variables and the outcome variable are durations in weeks, therefore the marginal effect of interest, which in our linear regressions turns out to be the estimated coefﬁcient of X mat on each type of job interruption, has a clear and direct interpretation in terms of effectiveness of the policy. 
The drawback of our modelling choice is that we cannot account for censored ‘‘in job’’ or ‘‘out of job’’ spells. 
Nevertheless using retrospective information collected from relatively old women reduces the potential bias to the minimum: in our sample we have no censored ‘‘in job’’ spells, i.e. there are no women who are currently employed but not at work because in maternity leave, and a very limited number of women who never returned to work after a childbirth and still not retired. 
X contains demographics, characteristics of the job of the mother at the moment of childbirth, a set of variables explaining the fertility decision and a full set of country dummies. 
Demographics include years of education of the mother, age of the mother at childbirth, dummies indicating whether the mother had a partner and whether the partner was working at time of childbirth. 
Employment characteristics are modelled as dummies indicating whether the mother was self-employed prior to the maternity, a fulltime employment dummy, sector dummies (agriculture, manufacturing and public employees, private services is the excluded category), and the (log of) wage. 
9 Regressors concerning fertility decision are the number of brothers and sisters a woman had at the age of 10 and whether the contraceptive pill was available in the country at the moment of childbearing. 
In order to fully account for unobserved common determinants the error terms are allowed to be correlated across equations. 
Since, as we explained, we estimate the system on a dataset of births, error terms are clustered by mothers. 
Our analysis is based on retrospective information about employment careers of women with children in the sample. 
The nature of our dataset may threaten the validity of our results: ﬁrst, respondents may not remember details about events that took place in the past with the adequate precision. 
Second, and more severe, they may be affected by recall bias: i.e. amounts and dates may not only be imprecise, but reported with a non-random bias. 
As an example, wages referring to jobs started prior to the French Franc devaluation in 1950 may all be reported wrongly by the same scale factor. 
Havari and Mazzonna (2011) analyse the issue in SHARELIFE and conclude that recall bias seems to be limited in the survey. 
Nevertheless we tried to estimate the system of equations excluding wage or replacing it with relative positioning in the countryspeciﬁc income distribution by decades, 10 and results regarding the key maternity leave policy variables are virtually unchanged.

Results are by and large unchanged compared to what we present in the paper. 
8 In our sample the number of women having more than 3 children and working at each child birth is small (see Table 1). 9 Being more precise, the logarithm of the ﬁrst salary or ﬁrst monthly earnings from self employment on the occupation in which the mother was at the moment of childbirth. 
SHARELIFE does not record the wage at childbirth. 
All wages are adjusted for inﬂation and purchasing power parity according to the procedure proposed for SHARELIFE by Trevisan, Pasini, and Rainato (2011). 
10 We deﬁne four periods: before 1950, between 1950 and 1970, between 1970 and 1990, and after 1990.

Comparing Tables 2 and A1, as explained in Section 3, it is evident that these cases are quite rare but their out of job length is, by construction, much longer than that of childbirths where the mother eventually return to work. 
In order to check whether results of our analysis where driven but those few observations, we repeated the estimation excluding them. 
Results, which are reported in Appendix conﬁrm that this is not the case: the marginal effects of variables of interest are by and large the same. 
6. Estimation results Table 4 reports estimation results for weeks off work when women keep the same occupation they had before child birth (‘‘in job’’), while Table 5 shows the results for weeks off work quitting the pre maternity employment. 
Descriptive statistics on covariates are displayed in Table A2 in Appendix. 
One extra week of full wage paid leave increases the time spent employed but not at work by 0.39 weeks at ﬁrst childbirth, by 0.41 weeks at second childbirth and by 0.66 weeks at the third. 
At the same time, one extra week of full wage leave reduces the time spent out of labour force at ﬁrst and second childbirth by 0.86 and 1.46 weeks respectively. 
The marginal effect on the third childbirth is negative but insigniﬁcant. 
This is conﬁrmed by Tables A7 and A8 in Appendix where we report the same estimations as Tables 4 and 5, but excluding women that never worked again after childbirth: all marginal effects are almost unchanged. 
Our ﬁrst conclusion is that more generous maternity leave schemes do not increase the total time spent off work at childbirth. 
This is an important result from a policy perspective: longer maternity leaves increase job-security and labour market participation of women, and conﬁrm the ﬁndings by Pronzato (2009) and Rønsen and Sundstro¨m (1996). 
Our contribution is that distinguishing between weeks of maternity leave ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’, we can go one step further in understanding how the policy affects decisions: mothers partially substitute weeks out of labour force with weeks not at work but employed continuously for the same employer. 
We can dig further and decompose the effect of maternity schemes into the pure effect of length of the maternity and generosity of the beneﬁt. 
Tables 6 and 7 report the estimation results for weeks ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’ respectively where the variable ‘‘weeks of full wage maternity leave’’ is replaced by its components, i.e. length and generosity of the scheme. 
The variable ‘‘length’’ signiﬁcantly increases the number of weeks spent employed but not at work, while the variable ‘‘generosity’’ of the beneﬁt has no statistically signiﬁcant effect. 
Partly in contrast with these results we see that a higher beneﬁt reduces the number of weeks spent out of the labour force at the ﬁrst childbirth, while the length of the paid leave plays no signiﬁcant role. 
The overall result is therefore consistent with the few previous empirical studies that decomposed the effect of the policy into length and generosity, namely Gustafsson et al. (1996) and Bergemann and Riphahn (2010): longer leaves induce longer job interruptions, higher beneﬁts reduce interruptions.

job’’ and ‘‘out of job’’ weeks, we can state that the effect of the maternity leave length does not reduce labour market attachment since it increases the number of weeks at home but employed, while has no effect on time spent out of labour market. 
As stressed by Troske and Voicu (2009), it is important to consider the effect of early interruptions on the successive ones: the longer the duration of time employed but not at work at ﬁrst child birth (weeks ‘‘in job’’), the longer is both the time off work but employed (weeks ‘‘in Table 5 Estimation results on weeks off work ‘‘out of job’’.

The same can be observed looking at the effect of the second childbirth on the third one.

also a full set of country dummies that are in general signiﬁcant but without a clear pattern. 
Such an evidence highlights the great deal of cultural and institutional heterogeneity within Europe: several factors concerning decisions on job interruptions at childbirth are likely to be country-speciﬁc and, as we mentioned describing Table 1, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in labour market participation of women, which are only partially accounted for by differences in maternity leave policies. 
Looking at the sign of country dummies, women who work at childbirth in Italy and Spain have a lower time spent off work both ‘‘in job’’ and ‘‘out job’’ than Germany (baseline country). 
The fraction of women working in Mediterranean countries is much lower than in Germany, therefore it is reasonable to think that ceteris paribus Mediterranean working women have higher labour market attachment than German ones. 
Unfortunately the sample size does not allow estimations of the same equations at the country level without losing statistical signiﬁcance; hence we cannot carry out a complete analysis of these relationships at the single country level. 
7. Conclusion In this paper we evaluate the effect of maternity leave policies on the time spent off work at childbearing. 
This is a crucial since the direct target of parent leave legislation is the period immediately after or around childbearing. 
The reason is that most of the effects of fertility on gender differences in labour market outcomes are mediated by the time spent at home for child caring. 
We use a new dataset, namely SHARELIFE, which has the advantage of recording full fertility and labour market histories of European women, and allows to exploit heterogeneity in the leavetaking choices across countries, over time and over individual life-cycle paths, i.e. on successive child births. 
We complement SHARELIFE with a database of maternity leave schemes characteristics across countries and over time. 
The combined lifecycle and institutional data we use lead to robust evidence about the effect of length and generosity of statutory maternity leave. 
We model the separate effect of the length and generosity of maternity leave beneﬁts at each childbirth by making use of a triangular system of regressions and explicitly accounting for state dependence in job interruptions. 
The main policy implication of our paper is that maternity leave legislation in Europe seems to effectively target the objective it is designed for: a more generous maternity leave induces women to have shorter off work periods and higher labour force participation. 
Being more speciﬁc, a longer leave increases job-security increasing the number of weeks spent employed but not at work, while a higher beneﬁt increases labour market participation reducing the period spent out of the labour force. 
The differentiated effect of the length and the beneﬁt level characterizing maternity leave provisions allows policy makers to better shape policies. 
In countries where labour market turnover is low governments are more concerned about job protection: continuity within the same occupation can be facilitated by lengthening the paid maternity leave. 
On the contrary, when the turnover is high and female labour market participation is the main concern, governments should increase the level of the beneﬁt. 
The regression results highlight signiﬁcant country differences in female decisions about labour market participation which are likely to depend on countryspeciﬁc cultural factors as well as welfare state features beyond what can be captured by our analysis. 
In particular we can control for country differences but we cannot run separate ‘‘country-regressions’’ due to the sample size limitations. 
Moreover, a more complete set of institutional features, such as child care provisions, family allowances, nursery and primary school availability and parental leave available across countries and over time, would allow us to enrich the current ana lysis and draw more general conclusions on the role of public int ervention in this area. 
If on the one hand building measures of these policies which are comparable across countries and along time is far from obvious (eligibility rules, type of beneﬁts and relations with other policies can differ widely from country to country), on the other hand our paper provides a ﬁrst attempt at providing a coherent framework for this type of analysis which can be easily adapted for future research.
