This article explores the relationship between a firm’s human resource management system and “organizational ambidexterity.” Organizational ambidexterity (OA) refers to the ability of an organization to efficiently take advantage of existing market opportunities while creating and innovating to meet the challenges of future markets (Andriopoulos & Lewis, 2009; Benner & Tushman, 2003; Duncan, 1976; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). 
OA serves as a parallel to individual ambidexterity, which refers to an individual’s ability to use either his/her left or right hand with equal dexterity (Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, & Veiga, 2006). 
Similarly, OA focuses on the ability of the organization to both efficiently exploit its existing competencies (via “exploitation”) and foster the innovativeness (via “exploration”) to bring forth the products and services that will enhance future firm competitiveness (Abernathy, 1978; Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998; Hayes & Abernathy, 1980; Levinthal & March, 1993). 
Further, these capabilities of exploitation and exploration are often thought to compete against one another as scarce resources are divided to meet the demands of both (Abernathy, 1978; March, 1991). 
In other words, a focus on efficiency may be antithetical to the flexibility necessary to create innovations within a firm (Abernathy, 1978). 
Despite the inherent contradictions in organizational structures and systems that lead to either efficiency or innovation, organizational scholars have called for the necessity of cultivating both competencies within a firm (e.g., Bierly & Chakrabarti, 1996; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; He & Wong, 2004; Katila & Ahuja, 2002; Lubatkin et al., 2006; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). 
Researchers have suggested that firms may achieve both exploration and exploitation through structural methods of differentiation within themselves (Duncan, 1976; March, 1991). 
This structural view of ambidexterity is a work flow model that encourages both exploration and exploitation by building separate organizational units tasked with the dissimilar goals associated with these activities, or by creating temporal separation in the sequencing of organizational activities (Duncan, 1976; Lavie, Stettner, & All authors contributed equally.

Although the achievement of structural forms of OA is often a viable model for larger firms, it is a resource-consuming strategy requiring duplicate organizational functions and is thus not an option for all firms (Duncan, 1976; Lubatkin et al., 2006; March, 1991; Raisch, Birkinshaw, Probst, & Tushman, 2009). 
Rather, constraints often require employees in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to focus their energies on both exploration and exploitation activities concurrently (Lubatkin et al., 2006). 
SMEs are more likely to pursue ambidexterity by creating a behavioral context that requires the integration of different activities at lower organizational levels (Andriopoulos & Lewis, 2009; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Mom, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009). 
Gibson and Birkinshaw suggested that organizational performance can be enhanced by developing “a carefully selected set of systems and processes that collectively define a context that allows the meta-capabilities of alignment and adaptability to simultaneously flourish, and thereby sustain business unit performance” (2004: 210). 
These authors further identified stretch, discipline, support, and trust as elements of an organizational system that are necessary for producing a more behavioral model of ambidexterity, which they term contextual ambidexterity. 
However, beyond work on these general characteristics, little empirical work has been done to identify organizational systems that facilitate the behavioral or “harmonic” view of ambidexterity (Lavie et al., 2010; Simsek, 2009; Simsek, Heavey, Veiga, & Souter, 2009). 
This study attempts to address this gap by building on existing work on the behavioral view to examine the extent to which one such system—the human resource management system—may serve as an antecedent that enables firms to develop a context for ambidexterity. 
More specifically, our aim is to assess the extent to which high-performance work systems (HPWS) may assist firms in developing a behavioral context that promotes ambidexterity in their workforces. 
In line with Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004), such systems are likely to emphasize alignment and adaptability via separate HR practices that work in concert to establish a context of “stretch,” “discipline,” “support,” and “trust,” which are noted to be necessary elements of an ambidextrous organization (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994). 
HPWS AND ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY Although the concept of an HPWS has not been consistently and precisely defined in the literature, it has generally been utilized to describe a system of horizontally and vertically aligned employment practices designed to affect both the ability and the motivation of employees (Huselid, 1995; Takeuchi, Chen, & Lepak, 2009; Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang, & Takeuchi, 2007). 
These employment models have an overarching goal of attracting, retaining, and motivating human resources toward the completion of organizational goals by creating a fit between the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a person and the tasks, duties, and responsibilities required by a job. 
The literature in this area has consistently argued that the practices themselves do not produce competitive advantage; rather, performance gains arise from the human resources that are developed by an HPWS system (Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg, & Kallerberg, 2000; Huselid, 1995; Wright, Dunford, & Snell, 2001; Wright, McMahan, & McWilliams, 1994). 
By the same logic, behavioral ambidexterity is not likely to arise from a set of practices, but rather out of a firm’s unique human resource base (Barney, 1991). 
More specifically, it is realized through the flexibility of allocating the time and attention of human resources toward exploration and exploitation (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Lepak, Takeuchi, & Snell, 2003). 
As Kang and Snell stated, “contextual ambidexterity assumes that the ambidexterity of an organization as a whole derives from specific actions of individuals so that it is inextricably tied to a firm’s efforts to manage human resources” (2009: 66). 
Similarly, Gibson and Birkinshaw stated that ambidexterity is developed by “building a businessunit context that encourages individuals to make their own judgments as to how best divide their time between the conflicting demands for alignment and adaptability” (2004: 211). 
In other words, organizations pursuing behavioral forms of ambidexterity must put in place practices that work to develop resource flexibility in their employee base, so that human resources have the discretion and motivation to devote their efforts to activities associated with both exploitation and exploration (Cordery, Sevastos, Mueller, & Parker, 1993; Lepak et al., 2003). 
This is an important distinction, as the flexibility does not lie with the system, but rather with the behavioral choices of the human resources asked to 2013 1421Patel, Messersmith, and Lepak meet the disparate goals of their organization (Wright & Snell, 1998). 
For instance, Toyota’s demonstrated ability to both explore and exploit concurrently has been attributed to the problem-solving ability of its employees at all levels of the organization (Lavie et al., 2010; Takeuchi, Osono, & Shimizu, 2008). 
Further referencing Toyota as an exemplar, Macduffie noted that much of the firm’s success can be attributed to its ability to develop dynamic capabilities, which result from investments “in the human resource practices that boost employee motivation, skill, and adaptability” (Adler et al., 2009: 109). 
Although the ability to achieve ambidexterity arises out of a human resource base itself, it is likely to be supported by the system of HR practices employed by an organization. 
More specifically, the literature emphasizing behavioral models of ambidexterity has stressed the need to build an organizational context that allows a firm to be properly aligned with an existing market but also adaptable to changing market realities (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). 
Such a context is thought to promote both alignment and adaptability (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). 
Alignment: Achieving Stretch and Discipline via an HR System Alignment is the capability to develop “a clear sense of how value is being created in the short term and how activities should be coordinated and streamlined to deliver value” (Birkinshaw & Gibson, 2004: 47). 
Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) invoked Ghosal and Bartlett’s (1994) work to demonstrate that alignment is produced through an organizational context that combines discipline and stretch. 
Discipline is thought to be a function of having clear performance standards and expectations, swift and open feedback systems, and consistency in how employees are managed (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994). 
Stretch, on the other hand, refers to an organizational context in which members voluntarily and actively push their own standards and expectations to higher levels (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994). 
An organization’s HR system is likely to play an important role in producing these contextual elements. 
Many of the traditional elements of an HR system are designed to match employees closely to the demands of specific jobs. 
Hayton suggested that traditional HR practices focus upon “clearly defining jobs in terms of their tasks, duties, and responsibilities; carefully structuring equitable rewards for those jobs; and monitoring individual performance” (2003: 386). 
Such practices are generally derived from a formal job analysis program, in which job descriptions and job specifications are developed to ensure fit between a person and the job he or she is asked to perform. 
This job analysis information is then used to create valid selection instruments that identify people with the proper skill profile for a given job, to create training programs to transfer the correct pieces of knowledge necessary to do the job, to form performance appraisal mechanisms, and to fairly compensate individuals on the basis of identified compensable factors. 
These practices are likely to assist in producing a context that supports alignment with existing opportunities. 
The theoretical link between such HR practices and an alignment-based context of discipline and stretch is straightforward. 
Discipline exists within an organizational system when employees understand what is expected of them, are provided with the proper skills to meet those expectations, and are held accountable for their actions. 
The second important element in achieving the alignment discussed by Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) is stretch. 
Stretch occurs when employees are given goals that “raise the bar” regarding previous performance targets. 
An HR system can be useful in building such a context by helping to form a context encouraging the attainment of more and more ambitious goals (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). 
Such goals may be particularly powerful motivators when aligned with a proper set of incentives. 
When employees are offered financial benefits for exceeding goals and targets, they are more likely to feel the positive sense of stretch that is necessary to build an ambidextrous organization. 
While the research literature on the link between incentives and performance shows mixed outcomes, the metaanalytic results suggest that, when properly aligned with other organizational practices, incentive pay works to motivate employees to reach defined objectives (Jenkins, Mitra, Gupta, & Shaw, 1998). 
Therefore, when utilized properly, incentives may play a pivotal role in creating a context of stretch in an organization. 
Adaptation: Achieving Support and Trust via an HR System Adaptation refers to a firm’s “ability to move quickly toward new opportunities, to adjust to vol1422 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal atile markets and to avoid complacency” (Birkinshaw & Gibson, 2004: 1). Adaptability is likely to result from practices that enhance support and trust within the organization (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004). 
Support refers to the resources, care, and autonomy provided to employees (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994). 
Meanwhile, trust is thought to be influenced by perceptions of equity within the organization, the competence of organizational leaders, and the level of involvement offered to employees (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994). 
Elements of the firm’s HR system are likely to be useful in building a context characterized by trust and support. 
For instance, trust can be enhanced through practices associated with internal advancement opportunities and job security. 
Firms that offer these practices are likely to be deemed more trustworthy by employees who sense that they are valued members of their organizations. 
As such, the human resource base may be more prone to engaging in discretionary efforts beyond those set forward in their job description. 
Further, firms that provide employees with greater career mobility and promotion potential are likely to have a more adaptable workforce because of higher levels of perceived trust. Employees who see that multiple advancement opportunities are available to those who succeed may be more likely to take calculated risks. 
Such employees may feel empowered by the organizational system and will be more motivated to try new approaches. 
For instance, Ramirez (2007) argued that strong internal labor markets that focus on development and advancement help to establish stronger firm-level competencies. 
Greater advancement opportunities provide signals to employees that they are empowered to make critical decisions and are likely to be rewarded with promotions if they demonstrate a propensity for risk taking. 
Further, through measures to ensure a degree of job security, organizations are more likely to promote risk taking, which may lead to more innovative outcomes for the firms. 
For instance, in a research-based text on corporate entrepreneurship, Morris, Kuratko, and Covin state: “Moreover given that risk implies failure, appraisal and reward systems should reflect a tolerance of failure and offer some employment security” (2008: 172). 
Similarly, support can be enhanced via a firm’s HR system through information sharing and participation programs. 
Such programs allow employees to work with each other to develop solutions that may not be readily created by single employees. 
Providing avenues for employees to engage in information exchange and mutual problem solving builds a context of support in which employees see themselves as part of a larger group seeking broader goals and outcomes. 
Firms that utilize decentralized and team-based decision making have been noted to create more technological innovations (Perdomo-Ortiz, Gonzáles-Benito, & Galende, 2009). 
Similarly, Beugelsdijk (2008) studied the effect of various HR practices on firm-level innovation and found that firms with decentralized organizational structures, which provide task autonomy and flexible work, generate more product innovations. 
By delegating authority to lower levels and empowering employees to make important decisions, a firm is likely to generate more innovative solutions than are typically enjoyed by firms with less involvement-oriented structures (Hornsby, Kuratko, & Montagno, 1999; Hornsby, Kuratko, & Zahra, 2002). 
The System Effect: HPWS and Organizational Ambidexterity Conceptually, while individual HR practices may be geared toward building discipline, stretch, trust, or support, respectively, it is likely that combining these different sets of practices into an HPWS will promote a context that helps to create an ambidextrous workforce. 
Conceptually, this implies that one set of HR activities helps to build a resource base capable of exploiting existing market realities, while another set of activities works to simultaneously build the resource adaptability necessary to explore new opportunities. 
In other words, discipline and stretch are created by more alignment-oriented HR activities, while support and trust are created by more adaptation-oriented HR activities. 
This is not to say that there will not be crossover effects for individual practices. 
For instance, properly designed incentive programs may enhance both efficiency and innovation simultaneously. 
Similarly, selective staffing along certain dimensions can enhance both alignment and flexibility. 
However, the greater point is that when an HPWS is utilized that combines practices aimed at each of the contextual elements into a single system, an organization is more likely to overcome the inherent tensions between exploration and exploitation via the ambidextrous capabilities of its workforce. 
In other words, such a system works to create a human capital pool that can achieve both fit and resource flexibility (Lepak et al., 2003; Wright & 2013 1423Patel, Messersmith, and Lepak Snell, 1998). 
Alignment-based practices such as job analysis, job-based staffing, performance appraisal, incentive-based compensation, and training programs help an organization ensure that individuals have the knowledge, skill, and ability to effectively perform their current job demands in a productive manner. 
These practices create a clear sense of stretch and discipline (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994) in the organizational system by clearly defining performance, selecting individuals best suited to meet those standards, assessing performance relative to the goals set by the organization, and stretching individuals to exceed expectations via incentives. 
Further, by carefully matching individuals to jobs and training employees to perform their tasks efficiently, an organization can help to free up more time for exploratory activities. 
In addition to added time resources, the promotion of advancement opportunities, job security provisions, participation, and information sharing elements of an HPWS allows for a greater sense of trust and support (Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994) within the organization. 
Wright and Snell (1998) referred to these components as the “participative infrastructure” of an organization. 
Such a context helps to develop flexibility within the resource base and allows for the creation of more innovative solutions. 
In other words, a well-crafted system of HR practices is likely to produce a workforce capable of adapting to the changing needs of the market (Wei & Lau, 2010). 
It is important to note that the logic of combining one set of practices that produces alignment with another set that produces adaptability is dependent upon the complementarities between these disparate practices. 
These practices are not inherently orthogonal to one another, but rather serve different purposes in eliciting and motivating desired behaviors from human resources. 
For instance, when a firm chooses to utilize selective staffing practices that closely match individual skill sets to job requirements, this choice does not preclude the organization from also utilizing participation programs and information sharing practices. 
Rather, utilizing such practices in concert helps to ensure that talented human resources interact and share their specific knowledge with one another in the pursuit of goals and objectives that require multiple skill sets. 
Similarly, firms that implement incentive-based compensation programs along with relative job security provisions are not creating competing practices but complementary practices. 
Individuals who are provided with incentives to meet challenging goals (stretch) but who are given some assurance that risk taking will not result in the loss of employment (trust) are more likely to proactively seek new opportunities without fear of being dismissed if the risk fails to bear fruit. 
In such cases, the employee is stretched to meet performance standards, while maintaining trust that the organization remains committed to his or her future with the firm. 
Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) suggested that firms achieve ambidexterity when they are able to demonstrate alignment with existing opportunities while simultaneously demonstrating the ability to adapt to changing markets. 
Further, the authors argued that alignment results from an organizational context that exhibits discipline and stretch, while adaptation arises out of a context of support and trust. We have built on these arguments by suggesting that such a context can be established via an HPWS. 
Such systems are useful at helping a firm to balance exploration and exploitation by creating resource flexibility within its workforce. 
Therefore, we test the following: Hypothesis 1. HPWS utilization is positively related to organizational ambidexterity. 
The strategic HR literature has consistently found positive results between the adoption of HPWS and a host of performance metrics, including financial performance and sales growth, among others (Batt, 2002; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Messersmith & Guthrie, 2010; Takeuchi et al., 2007). 
In noting that the system itself does not produce a sustainable competitive advantage, this literature base has also long recognized the need to identify the mediating components that help to link HPWS utilization to firm performance (Batt, 2002; Becker & Huselid, 2006; Takeuchi et al., 2007). 
Recent studies have begun to address this issue (i.e., Jiang, Lepak, Hu, & Baer, 2012; Sun, Aryee, & Law, 2007; Takeuchi et al., 2007); however, much remains unknown regarding the myriad of mechanisms through which performance is altered or affected by a firm’s HR system. 
Organizational ambidexterity may be one such component through which HPWS has an influence on performance outcomes. 
In fact, ambidexterity has been linked to performance in a host of organizational studies. 
For instance, Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) reported an association between ambidexterity and perceived performance in a sample of 41 business units. 
Lubatkin et al. (2006) found a positive association between ambidexterity and rel1424 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal ative firm performance in a sample of 139 New England–based SMEs. 
Similarly, Cao, Gedajlovic, and Zhang (2009) reported a positive relationship between forms of OA and subjective relative performance in a sample of China-based firms. 
Also, He and Wong (2004) find support for an interaction effect between exploitation and exploration activities on sales growth. 
These results suggest that if firms are able to build effective HR systems that help to produce a more adaptable workforce, then this in turn may help to produce greater levels of innovation and improved performance. 
In particular, SMEs that are able to develop this competency for ambidexterity are likely to experience greater growth rates, an objective that is frequently high on the list of priorities for smaller firms (Messersmith & Guthrie, 2010). 
In a sample of technology-based SMEs, we expect firms that are able to leverage a flexible resource base to achieve greater growth rates than those lacking this competency. 
Firms that are able to combine a set of complementary HR practices into an HPWS are likely to see performance improvements through the mediating influence of organizational ambidexterity. 
Firms building the proper context for ambidexterity via an HPWS will likely see the fruits of this competency: a committed and flexible workforce that helps to drive the performance and growth of the organization. 
Therefore, we propose that HPWSs are able to affect SME performance and, more specifically, growth through the ability of such systems to produce an ambidextrous workforce. 
In turn, an ambidextrous workforce enables an organization to better take advantage of market opportunities while maintaining focus on exploiting existing markets. 
The net result is an organization with greater growth potential, because it is able to remain aligned with existing opportunities but adaptable to changing conditions. 
Thus, we test the following hypothesis: Hypotheses 2. Organizational ambidexterity partially mediates the relationship between HPWS utilization and firm growth. 
METHODS To test our hypotheses, we focused on high-technology manufacturing ventures of 10–250 employees in the midwestern US that were ten years old or younger. 
We used the Corptech directory as our sampling frame. 
The directory provides a comprehensive list of technology firms ranging from public to private firms and from domestic to foreignowned firms. 
Each directory listing provides information on firm name, location, product codes, SIC codes, top management team, and sales and employee information. 
A firm is initially identified through different sources such as technology newsletters, trade associations, press-clipping services, economic development agencies, and manufacturing/services directories. 
After a firm is initially identified, an interviewer from Corptech conducts a 15–20 minute interview with a senior executive. 
This interview is the basis for coding of the firm’s products and services, after which Corptech contacts it to read its profile and correct errors. 
The directory is updated yearly through the compilation of information from archival sources and telephone interviews. 
Information on a firm’s top management team, sales, and employees is obtained through telephone interviews, whereas information on product classes, industry membership, and firm location is drawn from archival sources. 
Compilation of firm information by Corptech and confirmation of the compiled details by a company executive provide additional corroboration through triangulation. 
The Corptech directory has been used in several studies (e.g., Lu & Beamish, 2001; Romanelli & Tushman, 1994). 
The data have been specifically used to assess innovation efforts in technology industries (Lee & Paruchuri, 2008; Puranam, Singh, & Zollo, 2003, 2006; Sine, Mitsuhashi, & Kirsch, 2006). 
To balance survey cost and scope, we focused on firms in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio. 
We were able to identify 1,526 ventures listed in the 2009 Corptech directory in these states. 
The high-tech manufacturing ventures represented in the 1,526 ventures were from 30 NAICS codes. 
1 Respondents were provided a tem1 Electronic computers (334111); computer storage devices (334112); computer terminals (334113); other computer peripheral equipment (334119); telephone apparatus (334210); radio & TV broadcasting and wireless communications equipment (334220); other communications equipment (334290); fiber optic cables (335921); audio and video equipment (334310); electron tubes (334411); bare printed circuit boards (334412); electronic capacitors (334414); electronic resistors (334415); electronic coils, transformers, and other inductors (334416); electronic connectors (334417); printed circuit assembly (334418); other electronic components (334419); semiconductor and related devices (334413); semiconductor 2013 1425Patel, Messersmith, and Lepak poral reference point, as they were asked to respond to items assessing all firm-level variables from the previous two years (2007 and 2008) and the current year (2009). 
Given their youth and the dynamic environment, these SMEs operate from a broader three-year reference point that includes the current year and that helps measure more generalized trends while ensuring that industry cycles are considered in establishing such generalizations. 
Prior to sending the survey, we conducted a pilot survey with two distinct groups: (a) six active researchers in the field of management and (b) eight CEOs of high-technology manufacturing companies in a large midwestern city. 
We first sought information from academic researchers to assess the face and content validity of the scales in the context of new ventures. 
Using feedback from the researchers, we made changes in the order and wording of survey items. 
In the next stage, we conducted personal interviews with eight CEOs using the updated scales. 
We used their feedback to change the wording of items that were deemed difficult to interpret, and we developed a glossary of terms that would help respondents in the final survey to provide more effective and valid responses. 
An additional pilot test of HR practices in ventures was also conducted (which we discuss later). 
The survey data were collected from CEOs. 
In the context of SMEs, CEOs are a relevant respondent group, especially in young ventures. 
Young and small ventures tend to have fewer hierarchical levels, which generally means that CEOs play a central role in the day-to-day management of ventures (e.g., Sharfman, 1998; Sine et al., 2006). 
A packet containing our survey, along with a cover letter and prepaid business reply envelope, was sent to the CEO of each firm. 
To enhance response rates, which are typically low for CEOs, we informed potential respondents that we would donate US$20 for every completed survey to a charity of their choice. 
After the first mailed survey and three follow-up reminder e-mails sent between October 2009 and January 2010, we received responses from 219 CEOs (14.35% response rate). 
Low response rates (10 –15%) are typical for mailed surveys to top executives (e.g., Bartholomew & Smith, 2006; Baruch & Holtom, 2008), particularly in privately held SMEs (Messersmith & Guthrie, 2010). 
In the final data set, we excluded four firms with incomplete data. 
This yielded a final sample of 215 firms. 
We tested for nonresponse bias by comparing early and late respondents and responding and nonresponding firms. 
We compared these groups with respect to firm age (early vs. late: F ϭ 0.83, n.s.; respondents vs. nonrespondents: F ϭ 1.04, n.s.), previous year sales revenue (early vs. late: F ϭ 0.32, n.s.; respondents vs. nonrespondents: F ϭ 0.80, n.s.), number of employees (early versus late: F ϭ 0.62, n.s.; respondents vs. nonrespondents: F ϭ 0.72, n.s.), across the 18 SIC codes (early versus late: F ϭ 1.02, n.s.; respondents vs. nonrespondents: F ϭ 1.14, n.s.), and respondent industry work experience (early versus late: F ϭ 0.32, n.s.). 
Each of these comparisons produced nonsignificant results. 
Using the above attributes for assessing late and early respondent bias and respondent and nonrespondent bias, we assess the joint effects of the above factors using Heckman’s (1979) twostep residual estimation (␳ϭ 0.02, p ϭ .86; inverse Mill’s ratio, 0.05, p ϭ .67;␴ϭ 0.04, p ϭ .59). 
These tests revealed no bias for early and late responders (␳ϭ 0.03, p ϭ .62; inverse Mill’s ratio: 0.04, p ϭ .71; ␴ϭ 0.04, p ϭ .53). 
In addition, we calculated sampling error by using the population of ventures in the high-tech manufacturing sector during 2009 in the US. Our sampling error (6.28%) was within the acceptable range (Särndal, Swensson, & Wretman, 1992). 
2 To further assess whether the sample represents the underlying population, we conducted Welch’s t-test, which assumes different sample sizes and unequal variances (firm age: t ϭ 1.47, p ϭ .14, firm size: t ϭ 1.04, p ϭ .30, number of employees: t ϭ 1.40, p ϭ .16, firm sales: t ϭ 1.37, p ϭ .17, number of new products introduced in the last three years [2008–10: t ϭ 1.48, p ϭ .14], and number of new products introduced in that period that were not in product classes during machinery (333295); search, detection, navigation, guidance, aeronautical, and nautical systems and instruments (334511); automatic environmental controls (334512); industrial process control instruments (334513); totalizing fluid meter and counting devices (334514); electricity measuring and testing equipment (334515); analytical laboratory instruments (334516); other measuring and controlling instruments (334519); electromedical and electrotherapeutic apparatus (334510); irradiation apparatus (334517); optical instrument and lens (333314); and photographic and photocopying equipment (333315). 
2 Based on the population of all firms listed in the high-tech SIC codes and located in the geographical region, assuming a 10 percent response rate and a 99% confidence interval. 1426 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal the previous three years [2006–08] t ϭ 1.30, p ϭ .19). 
Measures Dependent variable: Firm growth. 
We use the average of sales and employee growth for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. 
To achieve triangulation, we used multisource sales and employee data, from Corptech, Dun and Bradstreet Million Dollar Directory, and the Ward’s Directory. 
We were able to match all 215 ventures from at least two sources. 
Information on 32 ventures was available in all three directories. 
We take the mean of reported sales and employees during 2008–10, for which sales growth is measured as the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR): Sales CAGR ϭͩ sales 2010 sales 2008 ͪ 1⁄3 Ϫ 1. Employee growth is also measured as a CAGR of employees during 2008–10. 
HPWS. 
We used a measure of HPWS derived from Sun et al. (2007), who drew upon prior research (i.e., Bae & Lawler, 2000; Bamberger & Meshoulam, 2000; Delery & Doty, 1996), to develop a 27-item scale (from 1, “strongly disagree,” to 5, “strongly agree”) to measure integrated high-performance HR practices. 
The index is based on eight unique domains for HR systems. 
However, use of traditional HR practices has been increasingly questioned in the case of SMEs (Sels, De Winne, Maes, Delmotte, Faems, & Forrier, 2006). 
To ensure that the scale was relevant to respondents, we first conducted a pilot study, followed by exploratory factor analysis, and tested for convergent and divergent validity. 
As the dynamics of the human resource management system may be quite different for SMEs because of the costs resulting from an excessive focus on HR practices, young firms may not realize the full benefits of HR policies due to a lack of economies of scale. 
Therefore, to ensure that the CEOs of the young ventures perceived the HR scales in a similar fashion to typical managers in larger firms (a common data source in strategic HR research), we conducted a pilot study of the index on 21 CEOs of young (age Ͻ 10 years) high-technology manufacturing ventures in the Midwest, and also on four researchers who were actively conducting research on HR policies in small firms. 
Drawing on their feedback, we added a glossary and further clarifications of survey objectives. 
To assess validity and reliability, we started with exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring to uncover the underlying factor structure of the high-performance HR practices (Table A1 of Appendix A). In line with earlier work by Sun et al. (2007), the rotated factor matrix produced an eightfactor solution. 
Individual item loadings, reliabilities, and average variance extracted (AVE) are listed in Table A2. The alpha reliabilities for the subscales were equal to or above the .70 criterion (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998). 
Following this, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the factor structure of the 27 high-performance work practices. 
This analysis showed acceptable fit (␹ 2 /df ϭ 1.49; CFI ϭ .94, TLI ϭ .92, RMSEA ϭ .06, SRMR ϭ .05). 
As shown in Table A2, the high-performance human resource practices scale included eight dimensions: selective staffing, extensive training, internal mobility, employment security, broad job design, results-oriented appraisal, rewards, and participation. 
The AVE values are above 0.5 and hence indicate discriminant validity among the subscales. 
In the context of operationalizing HPWS, Becker and Huselid called “for a unitary index that contains a set (though not always the same set) of theoretically appropriate HRM practices derived from prior work” (1998: 63). 
Based on the traditional approach for operationalizing the HPWS measure, we used an additive index to reflect a single comprehensive measure of a firm’s HR system (Bae & Lawler, 2000; Batt, 2002; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995). 
A high score on this measure indicates a relatively intensive investment in high-performance work practices. 
Organizational Ambidexterity Ambidexterity was assessed by using measures of both exploration and exploitation. 
Measures of both of these constructs are based on an established 12-item scale published by Lubatkin et al. (2006). 
The six items used to measure exploration (see Appendix A;␣ϭ .87) included “the venture... bases its success on its ability to explore new technologies.” Similarly, the six items used to measure exploitation (␣ϭ .86) focused on issues such as “the venture...commitstoimprove quality and lower cost.” The 12 items asked the CEO to assess exploration and exploitation during the past three years on a Likert-type scale (1, “strongly disagree,” to 5, “strongly agree”). 
Individual item loadings for exploration and exploitation show ade2013 1427Patel, Messersmith, and Lepak quate convergent and divergent validity (see Table A2 in Appendix A). We measured the congruence between exploration and exploitation using latent congruence modeling (LCM) to incorporate measurement error and model covariance among individual items under exploration and exploitation (Appendix B). We refer to this outcome variable as “ambidexterity congruence.” Control variables. 
We control for a number of theoretically relevant factors. 
First, since the likelihood of using an HPWS may increase with company size (Guthrie, 2001), we control for firm size by including a variable measuring the mean number of employees (natural log) in an organization in the past three years (2007–09). 
Firm age (number of years since start-up) in 2009 was included as a control to study the time available for developing HRM practices and the possible learning curve effects on productivity (Guthrie, 2001). 
Information for firm age and firm size were obtained from Corptech and the Dun and Bradstreet Million Dollar Directory. 
In case of discrepancies, we use the average of reported information from the two data sources. 
At the firm level, we add self-reported R&D intensity to control for the extent to which firms invest in innovation. 
As the level of stability in a firm’s industry is likely to affect its performance characteristics, we also control for environmental dynamism. 
We sum the net sales for all firms in the Corptech database at the six-digit NAICS code level between 2005 and 2009. 
Then, we regress the five previous years’ industry sales against year, using the equation y t ϭ b 0 ϩ b 1 ϫ t ϩ e t , where y t is industry sales, t is year, and e is the residual. Environmental dynamism is measured as the standard deviation of the regression coefficient (b 1 ) (Keats & Hitt, 1988). 
Environmental munificence is the regression coefficient (b 1 ) from the regression for environmental dynamism, for which a higher beta indicates higher sales growth and therefore greater munificence (Dess & Beard, 1984; Keats & Hitt, 1988). 
Environmental complexity is the regression of market shares of all firms in the industry in year 2009 on market shares in year 2005. 
As higher beta indicates increasing market shares and decreasing fragmentation, we multiply the beta by Ϫ1 so that higher values indicate greater complexity (Heeley, King, & Covin, 2006). 
Finally, it is likely that social desirability could lead to biased responses on innovation and HRrelated practices. 
To partially control for such effects, we use a ten-item social desirability scale (␣ ϭ .78) from Strahan and Gerbasi (1972) that has been extensively validated as a short-form social desirability scale (e.g., Reynolds, 1982; Thompson & Phua, 2005). 
In addition to the direct effects of social desirability, we use additional interactions (social desirability ϫ HPWS and social desirability ϫ organizational ambidexterity congruence). 
Introducing additional interactions helps to explain unique social desirability related to HR practices and ambidexterity, respectively. 
RESULTS Prior to testing the hypothesized relationships, we evaluated the robustness of the model. 
First, to remove some of the effects of multicollinearity, the measures were mean-centered. 
To assess whether multicollinearity was a significant problem at the firm level, we calculated the variance inflation factors (VIF) and condition index. 
Multicollinearity was not a significant issue in this study, because all VIF values were below 10 (highest VIF ϭ 4.56), and the condition index was below 30 (condition index ϭ 19.62) (Hair et al., 1998). 
Although our outcome measures are derived from archival sources, the measures of HR practices and ambidexterity could share common method variance. 
Drawing on survey design guidelines proposed by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003), we changed the order of scale items, provided a glossary of terms, guaranteed confidentiality, and used clear response guidelines. 
Next, we used Harman’s one-factor test, which resulted in five factors accounting for 80.39 percent of total variance (eigenvalue Ͼ 1), and the first factor accounting for 15.64 percent of the variance. 
Third, following recommendations by Podsakoff et al. (2003), we included a method factor in the measurement model to explain relative variance explained by substantive factors and the method factor. 
Substantive constructs explained 93.62 percent of the variance, and the method factor explained 1.05 percent of the variance. 
Fourth, we calculated partial correlations between all the indicator variables in the model and the first principal component. 
We found statistically significant partial correlations between some of the predictor variables and criterion variables. 
Overall, although common method bias cannot be completely ruled out, the tests suggest that it was not a significant threat to the validity of findings according to these tests. 
1428 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal The bivariate correlations are presented in Table 1. The correlations show that HPWS to OA congruence is positive and significant (r ϭ .35, p Ͻ .001) and that OA congruence is positively related to firm growth (r ϭ .26, p Ͻ .001). 
To test the hypotheses, we used the robust weighted least squares (RWLS; MPlus 5.21) procedure, as it is prone to fewer estimation errors in smaller samples than alternative estimation methods (Flora & Curran, 2004). 
We present in Figure 1 the results from the RWLS estimation with standardized parameter values. 
The model fit was within the recommended cutoff criteria (␹ 2 ϭ 71.32, df ϭ 59, CFI ϭ .95, TLI ϭ .95, RMSEA ϭ .03 [90% CI: .02, .06], RMSR ϭ .02). 
The full mediation model provided worse fit than the partial mediation model (␹ 2 ϭ 81.32, df ϭ 60, CFI ϭ .90, TLI ϭ .88, RMSEA ϭ .07 [90% CI: .04, .01], RMSR ϭ .04). 
Therefore, we proceed with a partial mediation model. 
Hypothesis 1 proposes that HPWS utilization leads to higher levels of organizational ambidexterity, which was supported by the model (␤ϭ 0.51, p Ͻ .001). 
HPWS explained 24.6 percent of the variance in organizational ambidexterity. 
Hypothesis 2 proposes an indirect effect of HPWS on firm growth through organizational ambidexterity, which was also supported by the model (␤ϭ 0.12, p Ͻ .05). 
HPWS explained 10.6 percent of the variance in firm growth through increased ambidexterity. 
The indirect effects were based on bootstrap standard errors using 1,000 samples. 
Sobel, Aroian, and Goodman tests also supported partial mediation. 
We further assessed whether the findings could be replicated using a multiplicative measure of ambidexterity. 
Again, the partial mediation model (␹ 2 ϭ 74.26, df ϭ 61, CFI ϭ .95, TLI ϭ .94, RMSEA ϭ .04 [90% CI: .02, .06], RMSR ϭ .02). 
The full mediation model provided worse fit than the partial mediation model (␹ 2 ϭ 86.48, df ϭ 62, CFI ϭ .81, TLI ϭ .89, RMSEA ϭ .07 [90% CI: .04, .01], RMSR ϭ .04). 
The results were consistent with the proposed model (Hypothesis 1:␤ϭ 0.54, p Ͻ .01; Hypothesis 2: 0.14, p Ͻ .01), and HPWS explained 9.84 percent of firm growth through increased ambidexterity.

Although the measures of exploration and exploitation used in operationalizing ambidexterity are based on extant scales in the ambidexterity literature, showing the direct effects of HPWS on labor productivity and innovation may demonstrate the more proximal effects of HPWS. 
To assess these effects, we operationalize two measures that may reflect the twin goals of ambidexterity: (i) labor productivity and (ii) new products adjusted for number of employees. 
As widely espoused in the HPWS literature, labor productivity indicates employee efficiency in managing tasks (Boselie, Dietz, & Boon, 2005; Delery & Shaw, 2001; Dyer & Reeves, 1995). 
As a measure of employee innovation, we use new products introduced in the past three years divided by average number of employees in the past three years. 
As new product introduction requires significant cooperation among functional areas, employee involvement across an organization is considered central to achieving innovation (Ernst, Hoyer, & Rübsaamen, 2010; Luca & Atuahene-Gima, 2007). 
Prior research (e.g., Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995) has measured productivity as a logarithm of the ratio of firm sales to number of employees. 
We build upon this approach by including a three-year (2008, 2009, and 2010) prospective geometric average of labor productivity. 
We utilized the Corptech directory to obtain the information necessary to construct the innovation measure. 
The Corptech directory classifies products into different product classes. 
We operationalize introduction of incrementally innovative products as the number of new products introduced over 2008, 2009, and 2010 in the product classes in which a venture had offered products in previous years (i.e., before 2007). 
To measure the introduction of radically innovative products, we count the number of new products in product classes that were not in the venture’s product portfolio before 2007 but were introduced from 2008 to 2010. 
We next take the mean of incrementally and radically introduced products and divide it by average number of employees during 2008, FIGURE 1 Path Analysis a HPWS Organizational Ambidexterity Congruence Firm Growth R 2 = .22 0.12 * (0.06) R 2 = .11 0.29 * (0.12) R 2 = .13 0.51 ** (0.11) R 2 = .25 0.24 * (0.10) Controls Organizational ambidexterity level 0.14 ** (0.05) Firm size 0.18 * (0.08) Firm age 0.10* (0.05) R&D intensity 0.11* (0.05) Environmental dynamism –0.16** (0.06) Environmental complexity 0.09 (0.05) Environmental munificence 0.13* (0.06) Exploration 0.15* (0.07) Exploitation 0.19 * (0.08) Social desirability 0.04 (0.04) Social desirability × HPWS 0.03 (0.03) Social desirability × 0.03 (0.03) organizational ambidexterity congruence R 2 = .17 Overall Model Fit 2 = 71.32, df = 59; CFI = .95, TLI = .95, RMSEA = .03 (90% CI: .02, .06), RMSR = .02 χ Dashed line indicates indirect effects.

As shown in Figure 2, HPWS is associated with increased labor productivity (␤ϭ 0.27, p Ͻ .05) and the introduction of new products (␤ϭ 0.32, p Ͻ .05). 
This post hoc assessment provides further support to the notion that HPWS can be leveraged to achieve ambidexterity, operationalized as the simultaneous achievement of productivity and innovation. 
Robustness Checks First, we used variance components analysis to test the relative amount of variance explained by the independent factors in our model. 
Variance components analysis is traditionally used in genetics research to measure the relative variance explained by genetic and environmental factors. 
Although our theoretical propositions require separate tests and analysis for each outcome, assessing the relative effects of independent factors is particularly important. 
In Table 2, the variance component analyses for the two outcomes—organizational ambidexterity congruence and firm growth—are shown. 
In explaining firm growth, organizational ambidexterity congruence has the strongest effects (R 2 ϭ .23; 95% CI ϭ .18, .28). 
While exploration (R 2 ϭ .10; 95% CI ϭ .05, .15) and exploitation (R 2 ϭ .07; 95% CI ϭ .03, .11), explain unique and significant variance, the effects of jointly pursuing exploration and exploitation are significantly higher. 
Similarly, while HPWS (R 2 ϭ .10; 95% CI ϭ .08, .12) explains unique variance in firm growth; however, in indirect support of Hypothesis 1, HPWS plays a more significant role in facilitating ambidexterity congruence (R 2 ϭ .18; 95% CI ϭ .16, .20). 
Alternate specification of ambidexterity. 
To test the sensitivity of our results, we utilized different specifications of the ambidexterity measure. 
Specifically, we test four different operationalizations of ambidexterity: (a) absolute difference (Hypothesis 1:␤ϭ 0.52, p Ͻ .01; Hypothesis 2: 0.14, p Ͻ .05); (b) a difference score (Hypothesis 1: ␤ϭ 0.53, p Ͻ .01; Hypothesis 2: 0.13, p Ͻ 0.01); (c) sum (Hypothesis 1:␤ϭ 0.55, p Ͻ .01; Hypothesis 2: 0.13, p Ͻ 0.05); and (d) average (Hypothesis 1:␤ϭ 0.54, p Ͻ 0.01; Hypothesis 2:␤ϭ 0.14, p Ͻ.01). 
The direction, magnitude, and significance of our inferences did not change under these alternate specifications. 
Model power tests. 
To test the power of the overall model, we used Satorra-Bentler’s rescaled chi-square test to assess the level of statistical power. 
The test is based on a bootstrap-based inference method that uses covariance structure (Yuan & Hayashi, 2003). 
Using this method, the Satorra– Bentler scaled chi-square indicates a power of 85 percent. 
We also assessed power for each of the estimated parameters that relate to our hypotheses using Muthén and Curran’s (1997) and Muthén and Muthén’s (2002) Monte Carlo measure, comparing chi-square values for the complete model and a model in which one parameter of interest is constrained to zero.

DISCUSSION As the ambidexterity literature has stressed, organizations must find ways to maximize their efficiency in existing markets while maintaining a focus on creating future innovations (Abernathy, 1978; Benner & Tushman, 2003; Duncan, 1976; Hayes & Abernathy, 1980; Levinthal & March, 1993; March, 1991; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). 
This article helps to address this important issue by analyzing the relationship between high-performance work system utilization and organizational ambidexterity. 
The results indicate that firms implementing a complementary set of HR practices form an HPWS that assists in developing the resource flexibility necessary to produce ambidexterity, which is further linked to firm growth. 
Taken together, these findings contribute to existing knowledge in several ways. 
First, the study builds closely upon existing work on behavioral or harmonic models of ambidexterity (i.e., Ghosal & Bartlett, 1994; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Simsek et al., 2009). 
This study takes the dimensions of alignment—stretch and discipline— and matches them with tangible elements of an HR system. 
Those practices that are designed using traditional job analysis–based methods to closely fit individuals to specific jobs promote the overall alignment necessary to achieve efficiency. 
Meanwhile, the adaptation dimensions of support and trust are created and reinforced by participation mechanisms and career advancement opportunities that encourage employees to actively monitor their environments and make the necessary changes to explore new opportunities. 
In combining these practices, an HPWS can be utilized to simultaneously produce the elements necessary to achieve ambidexterity. 
Though previous scholars have noted that ambidextrous organizations are able to achieve this feat by employing flexible and innovative people (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Mom et al., 2009), little research has directly addressed this question (Raisch et al., 2009). 
Such techniques require employees to manage their own time and efforts at achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, thereby pushing the required balance to lower levels of their firm (Gilbert, 2006; Mom et al., 2009; Raisch & Birkinshaw, 2008; Raisch et al., 2009). 
This study points to one potential element of this puzzle, in the form of human resource management systems. 
Given the need to achieve exploration and exploitation from the same resource base, it stands to reason that the practices designed to manage the efforts of human resources would play a salient role in organizational efficiency and innovation. 
While further study of this phenomenon is necessary, the results of this analysis suggest that simultaneously employing practices that help to produce alignment and adaptation helps in turn to produce the necessary resource flexibility to meet conflicting demands simultaneously. 
This may help to differentiate HPWS from total quality management and other process management systems, TABLE 2 Variance Component Analysis Variables Firm Growth Organizational Ambidexterity Congruence Percentage CI Percentage CI Low High Low High Ambidexterity congruence 22.83 17.90 27.76 HPWS 10.07 7.70 12.43 17.64 15.54 19.73 Exploration 9.89 4.87 14.91 10.42 6.92 13.91 Exploitation 7.34 3.41 11.27 9.31 6.92 11.69 Error (exploration, exploitation) 7.02 1.36 12.67 Error variance 41.25 36.20 46.31 10.22 3.24 17.20 Joint correlation between the two variance component models 0.32** (0.11) ** p Ͻ .01 1432 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal which tend to drive organizations toward stability and efficiency in exploiting existing market opportunities but hinder organizational innovation (Benner & Tushman, 2003). 
The study results may also point to the potential positive results of taking a strategic approach to the utilization of HR practices. 
Firms that adopt more rigorous approaches to human resource management may see greater efficiency and may also exhibit the discipline necessary to achieve higher levels of organizational innovation (Damanpour, 1991). 
This reveals HR systems to be an important element of organizational design, which has long been noted to be a main driver of ambidexterity. 
As Adler and Borys stated, “The enabling column in the organization design matrix permits us to understand such hybrids. 
Once routine and non-routine tasks are both managed in an enabling way, the organization can become effectively ambidextrous (Duncan, 1976; McDonough & Leifer, 1983)” (1996: 79). 
The proper design of an HR system enables organizational ambidexterity by establishing the proper context for efficiency and innovation to develop. 
The results of this study are particularly poignant because of the focus on small to medium-sized technology-based businesses, which do not have the resources available to separate themselves into different structural units. 
Raisch et al. (2009) defined this problem as the differentiation versus integration question. 
Differentiation calls for exploration and exploitation activities to be structurally divided within a firm, while integration calls for a balance between both activities within the same organizational units. 
In larger organizations, ambidexterity may be achieved by dividing firms into separate units, some maintaining a focus on innovation while others are tasked with coming up with radical innovations to place the company at a competitive advantage in future markets (Adler, Goldoftas, & Levine, 1999; Duncan, 1976; March, 1991; McDonough & Leifer, 1983). 
In such situations it then becomes the responsibility of upper-level managers and top management teams to integrate the exploitative and explorative elements of a business efficiently (Smith & Tushman, 2005; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). 
However, small businesses are not likely to be afforded this luxury and therefore must rely upon integration strategies such as behavioral ambidexterity. 
This discussion also points to the levels issue put forward by Raisch et al. (2009). 
In small firms, in which integration is likely the most efficient solution, how can individuals be trained to simultaneously operate in efficient and innovative ways? 
These have been described as different skill sets that are difficult for single individuals to achieve (Gupta, Smith, & Shalley, 2006; O’Reilly & Tushman, 2004). 
The answer may again partially lie in the adoption of the proper set of HR practices that work to deliver a system whose objective is the creation of both efficiency-related competencies and innovation-related competencies. 
Although we must be careful not to overstep the data in this regard, it is possible that organizations are able to design selection systems that identify individuals with such competencies and also to create training and development programs that help to engender these skills in individual employees. 
This also requires the literature to take an extra step beyond the identification of ambidextrous managers (see O’Reilly & Tushman, 2004; Raisch et al., 2009) to also consider building such competencies in the employment base at large. 
In addition, the results provide further evidence for the connection between HPWS utilization and firm performance. 
In the present analysis, performance was operationalized as growth, partially mediated by ambidexterity. 
Moreover, these findings come in a study of small to medium-sized enterprises, which have not received a great deal of research attention in the strategic HR literature, despite multiple calls for investigations in this area (Hayton, 2003; Hornsby et al., 1999; Hornsby & Kuratko, 2003; Kang & Snell, 2009). 
The results suggest that the effect of HPWS tends to generalize to smaller firms that can still benefit from the rigorous adoption of cohesive human resource systems. 
Limitations and Future Directions The results of this study should be considered in light of its limitations, which also help to open the door to future studies in this area. 
Future research should take care to provide a better understanding of the relationship between high-performance work system adoption and organizational ambidexterity. 
The present study considers the mediation of organizational ambidexterity in linking HPWS to growth; however, the ambidexterity and HPWS data were collected at a single point in time. 
Future research should explore this relationship more fully in a longitudinal model. 
Also, we argue that certain HR practices may be linked specifically to differing elements of organizational context— discipline, stretch, support, and 2013 1433Patel, Messersmith, and Lepak trust—that produce an ambidextrous organization. 
Although these connections are theoretically useful, we did not directly observe or measure the contextual elements themselves. 
Future work should endeavor to produce measures of these elements to more clearly test the relationships of interest between HR systems and contextual ambidexterity. 
Relatedly, additional work is necessary to tease out the more nuanced aspects of the relationships between particular HR practices and the contextual elements necessary to produce organizational ambidexterity. 
A finer-grained assessment of different models of participation programs, selection programs, and compensation programs is necessary to truly understand the levers and mechanisms linking HPWS to organizational ambidexterity. 
In addition, the sample size for this study was relatively small, though still large enough to provide the necessary power to test our hypotheses. 
Future work using larger samples from a broader cross-section of industries would also extend the generalizability of the model. 
Relatedly, although the response rate for this study is somewhat low, it is well within the normal range for such studies of small, private firms; however, it would still be helpful to have a greater response rate to further rule out alternative interpretations. 
Response bias did not appear to be an issue in this study, but with a relatively small number of responding firms, we cannot completely rule out systematic psychological differences between respondents and those that did not participate. 
Future work is also necessary to carefully assess the degree of resource flexibility necessary for different sets of employees. 
In the present study, HPWS utilization was assessed without respect to the types of employees who were covered by the selected practices, which has been a common measurement technique in strategic HR research (i.e., Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995). 
Although this limitation is partially offset by the size of the organizations examined, future studies may choose to focus on similar issues in larger organizations and would thus be well served to generate a finer-grained understanding of who is covered by what practices and to what effect on organizational ambidexterity. 
It also bears noting that utilizing HPWS might not be possible or even beneficial in all organizational contexts. 
Employing a systematic collection of HR practices may increase costs and take time that some small firms are unable to spend. 
The particular value of such systems is likely highest in the context of firms resembling those assessed in this study—those in high-tech industries that are characterized by uncertainty and change. 
Those companies operating in less uncertain industries with more stable demand characteristics and longer product life cycles may find HPWS and ambidexterity to be unnecessary for their operations. 
Beyond the influences of the external environment, it also possible that the HPWS-ambidexterity relationship is affected by the intended and emergent strategies of differing organizations. 
For example, companies pursuing a cost leadership approach may find HPWS to be too costly for them to implement and remain viable in their market position. 
Such organizations may benefit from implementing an alignment-based system rather than an HPWS that includes adaptation-based practices. 
Resource flexibility is likely to be less necessary in such contexts. 
Conclusion Exploration and exploitation remain at the heart of successful organizations. 
Firms that are able to balance the demands of the market with a healthy view toward the future are likely to remain optimally situated in today’s fast-changing business world. 
This focus requires firms to be ambidextrous and to utilize their limited resource bases to simultaneously pursue efficiency and innovation. 
The results of this study point to high-performance work systems as a potential firm-level competency that can produce the ambidexterity necessary to generate superior firm performance. 
In particular, as firms try to do more with less, paying careful attention to the practices designed to select, train, compensate, and reward employees is likely to pay dividends for both organizational efficiency and innovation.

Drawing on theoretical notions of ambidexterity, we measured the congruence between exploration and exploitation. 
This was operationalized using latent congruence modeling (LCM) to incorporate measurement error and model covariance among individual items under exploration and exploitation. 
LCM is a variation of structural equation modeling that has recently been advocated as an appropriate tool to measure congruence (Cheung, 2009a, 2009b; Edwards, 2009). 
Drawing on the ambidexterity literature, we define congruence as the extent to which exploration and exploitation are conducted simultaneously. 
According to this definition, deviation in either direction would mean lower returns from ambidexterity. 
As explained elsewhere, the greater the equality in degree of exploration and exploitation, the higher the likelihood that firm performance will be enhanced. 
Modeling LCM As ambidexterity focuses on fit between two organizational competencies, LCM is particularly relevant in the context of ambidexterity research (Cheung, 2009a, 2009b). 
Statistically, although much of prior ambidexterity research uses algebraic manipulation of exploration and exploitation, the underlying assumption is that there are no measurement errors in operationalization of exploration and exploitation; however, a structural equation model setting allows modeling for measurement errors. 
LCM creates two second-order factors from two components of interest: the mean level of these two variables (“level”) and their difference (“congruence”). 
In this study, level represents the average of exploration and exploitation, whereas congruence represents similarity in the extent of exploration and exploitation within a venture (Cheung, 2009b). 
A latent factor for level is used to create the congruence measure by fixing loadings for exploration and exploitation at 1.0, and the latent factor for congruence is created by fixing the loadings for exploration at 0.5 and exploitation at 0.5. 
The two equations are formally specified as: Exploration ϭ ambidexterity level ϩ 0.5 ϫ ambidexterity congruence. 
(1) Exploitation ϭ ambidexterity level Ϫ 0.5 ϫ ambidexterity congruence. 
(2) Adding Equations 1 and 2 and rearranging the terms leads to: Ambidexterity level ϭ | (explorationϩexploitation) | ⁄2. (3) Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1 and rearranging the terms leads to: Ambidexterity congruence ϭ | exploration Ϫexploitation|. 
(4) The variance of the residuals and the intercepts for the second-order SEM equations were constrained to zero (Cheung, 2009b). 
Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess the measurement equivalence of the two components of congruence. 
A higher congruence score implied a greater difference between exploration and exploitation (i.e., dissimilarity rather than similarity). 
However, greater ambidexterity is intended to imply a smaller difference between exploration and exploitation. 
Thus, for ease of interpretation of the LCM results, we multiply the scores of congruence by –1. Measurement Equivalence Before testing the final models, we assessed three types of measurement equivalence: configural equivaTABLE A2 (Continued) Scale Description and Items Loading␣ 7.
