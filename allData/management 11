INTRODUCTION Word-of-mouth(WOM) and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), which are forms of customer-to-customer information exchange, have become subjects of interest for companies and marketing researchers as possible alternatives for traditional mass-media commercial advertisements, which have been losing their appeal due to increased competition. 
WOM is distinct from traditional sources of information, such as commercial advertisements, in two ways. 
First, WOM provides more credibility to customers than other sources of information. 
Beck (1992) explained the uniquely credible status of WOM as an information source, by arguing that WOM has a stronger influence on the purchasing decisions of customers because it is perceived as advices from other customers faced with similar circumstances. 
In particular, WOM has been found to be especially influential when customers make purchasing choices about newly-released products that they are aware of but are not wellAcademy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 informed about (Mahajan, Miller, and Kerin, 1984). 
Films, by nature, exhibit characteristics that are largely similar to those of newly-released products, and it has also been well established that WOM generally has a significant effect on the movie-going choices of customers (Austin, 1989; Bayus, 1985; Faber and O’Guinn, 1984; Neelamegham and Chintagunta, 1999). 
Second, unlike advertisements, which are transmitted to customers via mass-media, WOM information is easily accessible for customers via social networks (Benerjee, 1992; Brown and Reingen, 1987; Murray, 1991). 
The accessibility of eWOM has vastly expanded due to the rapid growth of the Internet population and is now available via various channels and forms such as Internet messengers, online forums, communities, or purchase reviews posted on shopping websites. 
The resulting eWOM is exerting an even larger influence on the information searching and purchase decision-making actions of customers than the offline WOM of the past (Bussiere, 2000; Chatterjee, 2001). 
Many websites are being used not only as providers of product information, but also as forums for information exchange, and heavily influence the purchasing decisions of customers. 
A few marketing studies that have been conducted on the subject of WOM data include: one study on the effect of WOM information from Usenet newsgroups on television shows (Godes and Mayzlin, 2004); one study on the effect of eWOM information on revenue, which analyzed the customer review data accumulated in the two online bookstores of Amazon.com and BarnesandNobles.com (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006); and one study on the effect of movie reviews posted on Yahoo.com on box-office revenue (Liu, 2006). 
This study has two objectives. 
The one is to identify the effects between box-office revenue and the volume as well as valence of movie reviews posted in the film sections of portal websites. 
The structure in the first analysis was more elaborate model in the previous studies (Bae et al. 2010). 
The other is to find out if the eWOM effects in the former result are equally applied to all the movies regardless of their revenue difference. 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Definition and Characteristics of WOM and EWOM The term “word-of-mouth(WOM)” was first used in a marketing study by Whyte, which was published in a 1954 edition of the Fortune magazine. 
Each researchers have adopted different definitions of WOM, but all agree that it consists of oral interpersonal communication. 
Zaltman and Wallendorf (1979) defined WOM communication as a non-profit interpersonal activity involving the direct conveyance and acquirement of information via conversation. 
Arker and Myers (1982) defined WOM as a form of advertising communication in which the advertisement recipient becomes an information source to those around him. 
Ritchins (1983) understood WOM as a process of information exchange concerning a product, which occurs in the consumer market. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 WOM communication is considered a more credible source of information than commercial advertisements, because the information provider evaluates products and services according to his independent judgment instead of advocating corporate interests (Silverman, 2001). 
Customers have been shown to be greatly influenced by WOM information in making purchasing decisions in a survey by McKinsey, which reported that 67% of customers rely on WOM information when purchasing products (Taylor, 2003). 
Particularly in the case of the purchase of newly-released products, which pose risks stemming from deficient information, WOM has been found to play an even larger role than usual (Mahajan, Muller, and Kerin, 1984). 
This is because of the fact that WOM provides credible information which decreases the risks that accompany the decisions of the customers. 
Electronic word-of-mouth(eWOM) occurs in the virtual world of the Internet (Bussiere, 2000; Henning-Thurau and Walsh, 2003; Henning-Thurau et al., 2004) such as Internet communities, purchase reviews posted in shopping websites, and audience scores about the movie. 
Chatterjee (2001) argues that eWOM, compared to its off-line counterpart, provides both positive and negative information simultaneously from more diverse and numerous sources. 
Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006) as well as Henning-Thurau et al. (2004) characterized eWOM as a convenient form of communication that possesses anonymity, as well as freedom from the restrictions imposed by time and space. 
eWOM can bring about different results according to the means by which it is employed. 
Companies can take advantage of its anonymity by using it to disseminate marketing messages in the guise of customer opinions, which can lead to better results than traditional marketing techniques (Mayzlin, 2006). 
Chen and Xie (2008) examined the relationship between product descriptions provided by sellers and online product reviews posted by customers. 
As a result, it was found that product description and customers’ online evaluation take on a more complementary role under the condition that the price of a product is low and its customers have a lot of information about the product. 
eWOM is a communication channel capable of rapidly disseminating large volumes of information (Bickart and Schindler 2002; Chatterjee 2001), and much research is being conducted to investigate methods to reach customers through eWOM as well as more traditional marketing techniques. 
Previous Studies on Movie Success Factors Existing literature on movie success factors can be categorized into studies on the factors that consist of the properties of the films themselves and those that consist of customer information sources regarding the films. 
With respect to the former, Linton and Petrovich (1988) studied 15 properties of film including its characters, story, and background etc., amongst which the characters, story, and acting properties were identified to be important success factors. 
Also, Litman and Kohl (1989) studied the intrinsic properties and success factors of film and Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 categorized them into areas of properties (genre, appearance of star actors, rating, country of production, filming budget) and scheduling, distribution marketing efforts. 
Studies on the influence of information sources have focused on critical reviews(professional film reviews), previews, advertisement, and WOM. 
Although various studies identified different factors as being influential in each category, WOM and critical reviews were consistently found to be the most important information sources for customers. 
The importance of WOM in film success has been well verified in various studies. 
Faber and O’Guin (1984) argued that previews and WOM were the most credible sources of information in evaluating movies, and many other studies have concluded that WOM has an important effect on customers’ expectations, scores, and movie-going choices, as well as films’ success (Austin and Gordon, 1987; Mahajan et al., 1984; Levene, 1992; Zufryden, 1996). 
Studies on critical reviews, unlike those on WOM, offer differing conclusions. 
Hirschman and Pieros (1985) showed the existence of a negative correlation between box-office revenue and critical reviews. 
Faber and O’Guin (1984) verified the existence of a more important success factor in movies than critical reviews and Eliashberg and Shugan (1997) found that the influence of critical reviews changed with passing time. 
Litman (1983) identified the distributor, a Christmas season release date, and critical reviews as major factors in film success, while Basuroy et al. (2003) argued that critical reviews acted as predictors for the success of a movie in its initial and later phases of release. 
Studies on critical reviews have thus yielded mixed conclusions, with their being no clear consensus regarding their influence on box-office revenue. 
Existing Studies on the WOM Effect in the Film Industry The film industry is characterized by its high-risk, high-return nature. 
Various studies have verified that 6 to 7 out of 10 released movies turn out to be less than profitable (Liu, 2006; Vogel, 2001; Shugan, 1995). 
Even in the case of large film production and distribution companies, the majority of their profits derive from a small number of blockbuster films, which has led them to increase investment in their advertisement (Eliashberg et al., 2006). 
Due to the nature of the film industry, there have been many studies on the various factors that influence films’ success, and the WOM effect has been considered to be an important movie success factor. 
The volume and valence of WOM have been studied as their most important attributes (Mahajan et al., 1984; Neelamegham and Chintagunta, 1999). 
The volume of WOM refers to the amount of WOM messages, while the valence of WOM shows the degree to which the messages convey positive or negative assessments or sentiments. 
Dellarocas et al. (2004), building on the Bass model, estimated the Bass parameters (p, q) of the coefficient of innovation (p) and the coefficient of imitation (q) based on audience scores during the initial week of release. 
The size and density (the ratio between the initial-week boxoffice revenue and audience score size) of audience scores during the initial week of release were Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 shown to be useful in estimating p, while the scores themselves were shown to have explanatory power with regard to q. Duan et al. (2005) studied the daily relationship between audience scores and box-office revenue during the first two weeks of release through panel data analysis. 
They concluded that, while audience scores did not have significant explanatory power with regard to box-office revenue, the volume of WOM did. 
Liu (2006) found that the valence of WOM was higher before release, when expectations are higher, than after. 
According to this study, the valence of WOM did not have significant explanatory power with regard to box-office revenue. 
Moon et al. (2010) argued that box-office revenue exert a positive influence on the valence of the WOM of general customers, while the WOM effect (consisting of both reviews by professional critics and audience scores) only had a significant influence on box-office revenue when advertisements were employed at the same time. 
Chintagunta et al. (2010) found that the factor which influence the movie revenue is not the volume of the eWOM but the valence of it. PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY Some studies on the relationship between the movie revenue and WOM have asserted that, while the volume of WOM has a positive influence on box-office revenue, the valence of WOM does not affect box-office revenue (Liu, 2006; Duan et al., 2005). 
Others maintained that the factor influencing the movie revenue is the valence of eWOM (Chintagunta et al., 2010). 
In this study, the authors identify the relationship between the revenue and eWom under the consideration of mutual effects between both factors using Korean movie data. 
For verifying this, the authors improve the model in the previous studies (Bae et al., 2010) and propose a better structure regarding the relationship between the volume of WOM and box-office revenue. 
Existing studies on the film industry have assumed WOM to be an independent variable that affects box-office revenue. 
However, a more realistic assumption is one in which box-office revenue induced by WOM affects the volume of WOM again, the increase of which will also affect revenue. 
That is, previous studies have failed to consider the effect of the relationships and have overlooked the fact that WOM and box-office revenue have an endogenous relationship of mutual influence. 
Therefore, in this study, we will assume that box-office revenue and WOM volume exhibit a simultaneous and mutual influence, and define two variables as endogenous variables to perform analysis using a simultaneous equation. 
We expect that this will allow us to formulate a clear conclusion on whether WOM volume unilaterally affects box-office revenue, or vice versa, or if each of the variables are mutual causes for changes in the other. 
Finally, the effect of eWOM might be different between high revenue movie and low revenue movie because the movie earning a lot of revenue has numerous information sources besides eWOM to let the audiences be exposed to the movie like You Tube, twitter, Facebook, Online Community and etc. 
It means that the audiences don’t need to check the eWOM out before going to the theater because they already know the movie is great through other Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 information sources. 
Therefore there might be a small eWOM effect or no effect in the successful movies. 
RESEARCH MODEL Data Collection Data collection was performed upon the websites of Naver Movies (movie.naver.com), the Korean Film Council (www.kobis.or.kr), and Interpark Movies (movie.interpark.com), using a custom-programmed web crawler. 
Among the many websites with eWOM data, Naver Movies was chosen for the following reasons. 
First, Naver Movies, with its 32 million members as of August 2008, has, by far, the largest user base among similar sites, which allowed us to obtain a much larger and diverse sample of eWOM. 
Also, the extensive database of Naver Movies enables users to evaluate all films that have ever been domestically released. 
Second, Naver Movies requires users to log in to submit scores and allows each user to submit only one score per movie, which effectively prevents the possibility of a small number of users manipulating the overall scores. 
Third, the date, time, and score of each eWOM posting in Naver Movies are stored along with ID information of the poster, and all comments and movie data are stored permanently unless deleted by the original poster. 
Therefore, it is possible to accurately measure the valence and volume of WOM at any particular time after the release of a particular movie, by measuring the number of comments for a single movie by date, obtaining a weekly sum, and setting the result as the variable for the volume of eWOM; and obtaining the weekly average of the scores given in each comment and setting the result as the variable for the valence of eWOM. 
Finally, Naver Movies allows users to not only submit scores, but also share full reviews, and also provides critical reviews and news articles from such film magazines as Cine 21 and Film 2.0, thus allowing for the collection of additional data. 
Box-office revenue data was obtained from the integrated movie ticket network of the Korean Film Council, by collecting information from the box office page for the research period ranging from January 2005 to December 2007. 
The weekly sum of the collected data, beginning at the date of release, was obtained. 
As film information, including rating, running time, and genre, was often left out in the Naver Movies website, information from the Interpark Movies website was collected and used, as well as compared with data from the Naver Movies website. 
The ratings and running time information provided on the Naver and Interpark Movie websites were consistent with each other excluding those that were omitted in one site, and while genre information showed some difference due to categorizing difficulties, the differences in the other variables were verified to be small enough to not have any statistically significant influence. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Declaration of Variables and Summary Statistics Daily box-office data from the integrated movie ticket network of the Korean Film Council was gathered and added to obtain the box-office sales for each week of the first 8 weeks of release, the results of which were used as the box-office revenue data variable (LNREV). 
eWOM data was gathered by collecting Naver Movies comments, scores, and posting date. 
The eWOM volume variable (LNMSG) denotes the weekly sum of the daily data of the number of comments for a particular film obtained for the first 8 weeks of its release. 
The WOM valence variable (RATING) denotes the weekly average of the scores given in each comment. 
The WOM variance variable (VAR) denote the variance of weekly scores. 
The number of opening screens (SCRN) importantly affects box-office revenue, and its value changes daily. 
Therefore, the value for this variable was obtained by collecting daily data from the integrated movie ticket network and calculating their weekly average for the first 8 weeks of release. 
Film information was collected from Naver Movies and Interpark Movies and matched with the title information listed on the integrated movie ticket network of the Korean Film Council. 
Detailed information including ratings (DPG, DR), genre (GACTION, GCOMEDY, GSF), and star actor appearance (STAR) were obtained primarily from Interpark Movies, with Naver Movies as a secondary and alternative source. 
Movie scores submitted by professional critics (CRATING) was collected from the ‘Cine 21’ service section of the Naver Movies website. 
The movie scores showed in the ‘Cine 21’ section are the average values of aggregated film critic movie scores. 
The highest score is 10, and higher scores indicate more positive reviews. 
A variable for the number of new releases among the top 10 movies of week t (NEW) was included, along with another for the average time that the top 10 films of week t remained in theaters (AGE). 
These two variables (Elberse and Eliashberg, 2003) show the level of competition within a given week, in that, in the case of the former, the more the number of highgrossing films in the top 10 mark that were released in week t, the smaller will the relative volume of WOM for the study subject films. 
In the case of the latter, the shorter the average time in theater for high-grossing films in the top 10 mark, the larger the volume of WOM for these films, which may, in turn, reduce the volume of WOM for the study subject films. 
The data for these variables were collected from the weekly box-office data of the Korean Film Council integrated movie ticket network. 
The names and definitions of the variables used for statistical analysis in this study are listed below in <Table 1>. Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Table 1: List of Variables Used in Analysis of the Relationship between WOM and Box-Office Revenue Name of variable Definition t Elapsed time since date of release (weeks) AGE t Average time in theaters for top 10 movies released in week t CRATING Scores submitted by professional critics DPG PG Rating DR R Rating GACTION Action/Adventure Genre GCOMEDY Comedy Genre GSF SF Genre LNMSG t Volume of WOM during Week t (natural log) LNREV t Box-Office Revenue of Week t (natural log) NEW t Number of Top 10 Films for Week t that were newly released during Week t RATING t Average Audience Score for Week t SCRN t Number of Showing Theaters for Week t STAR Star Actor Appearance VAR t The Variance of the Score for Week t The final data set we used only contained films released during the research period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007. 
Also, under the assumption that art films, independent films, and re-releases are viewed by few audiences and are therefore inadequate for judging the effects of WOM, the subjects of this study were limited to films that had sold over 100,000 tickets during its first 8 weeks of release, which left us with 439 subject films. 
This assumption was adopted under concerns that, in the case of films with small audience numbers, the nature of this study, which employs the average value of evaluation scores submitted by audiences, would cause the opinions of a few members of the audience to appear as representing the general consensus regarding the film. 
Therefore, excluding these films from the analysis entirely was judged to be more appropriate. 
Pertaining to the films that were employed as subjects in this study, the total number of audience amounted to 405 million, the total volume of WOM data numbered 746,282, the total box-office revenue counted 2.08 billion dollars and the number of reviews by professional critics to 1,105. 
The summary statistics of the variables used in the statistical analysis of this study, as well as those variables that are considered important in the film industry, are laid out below in <Table 2>. Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Table 2: Summary Statistics of the Movie Sample Name of variable M Median SD Total number of audience 922,738 456,859 1,284,716 Accumulated revenue (millions in dollars) 4.75 2.32 6.64 Number of screens in opening week 147.1 129.5 83.9 Volume of WOM (opening week) 441.9 209.0 1,121.4 Audience evaluation score (opening week) 7.23 7.43 1.42 Accumulated volume of WOM 1,705.3 827.0 3,412.4 Accumulated audience evaluation scores 6.99 7.23 1.47 Accumulated critic scores 5.51 5.5 1.14 RESULTS OF EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS First, we adopted a hypothesis that took into account the previously overlooked possibility of a mutual relationship between WOM volume and box-office revenue, and formulated a simultaneous equation to estimate the coefficient values for each variable. 
Second, we divided the sample movie into two groups. 
One is the movies that earn top 50% revenues in the sample, the other is the movies that earns down 50% revenues in it. After that, we identify the mutual relationship between eWOM and the box-office revenues like the first analysis. 
In order to verify any differences in the influence of each independent variable upon the dependent variables in different time periods following film release, regression analyses and the simultaneous equation estimation were performed for each week for the first 8 weeks of film release. 
Mutual Relationship between Volume of WOM and Box-Office Revenue The relationship between WOM and box-office revenue is not one in which the former unilaterally affects the latter. 
A more realistic model is one in which an initial increase in WOM volume leads to an increase in box-office revenue, which in turn again affects WOM. 
Therefore, in this study, a model was set based on a simultaneous equation formulated using <Equation 1>, in which WOM volume affects box-office revenue, and <Equation 2>, in which box-office revenue affects WOM. 
This model makes it possible to determine which variable among WOM volume and box-office revenue is the cause for the changes of both, or, alternatively, verify the possibility that both may be mutual causes for changes in the other.

The residual term is assumed to follow normal distribution, 2 , (0, ) it i N ε σ. In <Equations 1>, the box-office sales variable(LNREV) is the dependent variable, and the volume of eWOM (LNMSG), the valence of WOM(RATING), the number of opening screens(SCRN), the professional critics(CRATING), the competition variables(NEW, AGE), and the variance of eWOM(VAR) are the independent variables. 
In <Equation 2>, eWOM volume (LNMSG) becomes the dependent variable. 
The variance of eWOM(VAR) and the dummy variables of star actor appearance (STAR), genre (GCOMEDY, GACTION, GSF), and rating (DPG, DR) influence eWOM volume. 
The endogenous variables of <Equation 1> and <Equation 2> are set as box-office revenue (LNREV) and WOM volume (LNMSG), while the remainder of the variables declared in this study are set as their exogenous variables. 
The estimation results of the two equations, obtained by using the 2SLS method, are shown in <Table 3>. In <Table 3>, the values listed above each of the variables are coefficient values, while those on the bottom are t-values. 
In the result for <Equation 1>table above, eWOM volume (LNMSG) does not have a significant effect upon box-office revenue after the first week of release, while eWOM valence has a positive correlation with box-office revenue. 
These results imply that the audience takes note of both the audience scores and volume of the eWOM posted on film information websites until the first week of release, but after that, the valence of eWOM acts as the primary standard for making movie-going choices. 
This implies that the audience put comparatively more importance on the opinions and film reviews of others like previous studies (Chintagunta et al., 2010). 
The variable of the number of showing theaters(SCRN) directly affects box-office revenue, which was reflected in the fact that it exerted a statistically significant influence on revenue from week 1 through 8. It is so obvious that the movie played at a lot of theater earns more than others. 
The variance of eWOM(VAR) doesn’t show the consistent results, which means it is inconclusive even if they are statistically significant in a few weeks. 
The data below in <Table 3> shows the results of the analysis performed on <Equation 2> of the simultaneous equation, in which box-office revenue affects WOM volume. 
The coefficient of the box-office revenue variable (LNREV) remains significantly positive from week 1 through 8. Considering the fact that the eWOM volume variable (LNMSG) in the data above in <Table 3> showed no statistically significant trend, it could be concluded that eWOM Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 volume is not the standard by which the audience makes movie-going choices, but is the result of increased ticket sales, which would lead to more related comments. 
This hypothesis is in direct contradiction with those of previous studies which asserted that eWOM volume influences boxoffice revenue (Liu, 2006). 
Even if some of these variations must be due to cross-country differences, it can be concluded that eWOM volume is a variable that holds little influence. 
This result is almost same as the previous studies (Bae et al. 2010) but it is necessary for the second analysis.

Is this result applied to all the movie at the same way? 
For example, if we compare ‘Transformer’ with ‘SAW 2’, the first earned 4 million dollars and the latter earns 0.2 million dollars in South Korea. 
The number of information sources about the ‘Transformer’ is more than ‘SAW 2’. It means that somebody who wants to watch the ‘Transformer’ doesn’t have to check the eWOM out before going to the movie theater because he or she already got a lot of information through Facebook, You Tube, Twitter, Blogs, on-line community, and off-line community on purpose or not. 
But if we intend to watch ‘SAW 2’, we don’t have much information about it, so that we have to check eWOM out on the movie website. 
Therefore eWOM effect is much smaller in the successful movies and is much bigger in the unsuccessful movie. 
We divide the sample movies into two groups. 
The first group(H) which earned 1.04 billion dollars(50%) of total revenue 2.08 billion dollars consists of 56 movies in 439 movies. 
The second group(L) is composed of the 383 movies that are the rest of the sample excluding H group. 
The summary statistics of the variables for both groups are laid out below in <Table 4>. Table 4: Summary Statistics of High Revenue Group(H) and Low Revenue Group(L) Name of variable H L M Median SD M Median SD Total number of audience 359.3 301.3 188.0 13.0 13.1 1.7 Accumulated revenue (millions in dollars) 18.61 15.70 9.64 2.77 1.87 2.26 Number of screens in opening week 270.7 243.3 132.0 129 119.7 54.5 Volume of WOM (opening week) 1534.0 875.5 2635.9 282.2 180 475.1 Audience evaluation score (opening week) 8.09 8.34 1.12 7.10 7.35 1.41 Accumulated volume of WOM 6552.7 4194 7783.8 1,100.7 745 1,334.7 Accumulated audience evaluation scores 7.87 8.07 1.10 7.01 7.25 1.42 Accumulated critic scores 4.90 5.67 2.48 4.06 5.00 2.56 The estimated results of <Equation 1>, <Equation 2> for H and L Groups by 2SLS method are shown in <Table 5> and <Table 6>. In the <Table 5>for the H group, we found that the WOM valence(RATING) and the eWOM volume(LNMSG) effects on the box office revenue are not statistically significant for all 8 weeks. 
It means that the audiences who want to watch the successful movie don’t have to rely on the WOM and have a lot of sources which give information about the movie to them. 
But in the <Table 6> we verify the same results that eWOM valence affect the box office revenue as <Table 3> in the previous analysis. 
As for this, we concludes that the valence of eWOM effect does not affect the box office revenue in the successful movie but it it does in the unsuccessful movie. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Both group showed that the number of screens have the statistical significant coefficient as previous result showed. 
It is also found that the coefficient of the box-office revenue variable (LNREV) in the lower table in the <Table 6>, <table 7> remains significantly positive from week 1 through 8, which proved that the volume of eWOM was induced by the movie revenue regardless of the size of revenues.

The result was almost same as the <Table 5> and <Table 6>. Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATION Some of previous literature on the film industry asserted that the volume, but not the valence of electronic WOM affects revenue (Liu, 2006; Duan et al., 2005). 
Others argues that the factor which affects the movie revenue is not the volume of eWOM but the valence of it (Chintagunta et al., 2010). 
In this study we found three important results. 
First, we partly support the result of the previous studies (Chintagunta 2010). 
It was found that the audiences are not affected by the volume of eWOM in their movie-going choices except the first week. 
In the first opening week, the audiences have little information about the movie, so that they guess how many people watched the movie by checking out the number of eWOM and also check the score of the movie that other audiences evaluate on. From the second week, they check out the score only because they have many ways to get the information about the number of people who watched the movie such as the newspaper. 
It means that the main factor that affect the movie revenue is the valence of eWOM. 
Second, it is found that the relationship between the variable of eWOM volume and revenue cannot be simply regarded as cause and effects in the previous studies(Chintagunta et al., 2010; Liu 2006). 
It is more appropriate that there is a structure in which increases in eWOM induced by revenue increases cause revenue increase again. 
Considering endogenous relationship between the volume of the WOM and the revenue, the real cause between these two variables is the revenue. 
It means that the evaluation on the movie is conducted after the person watched the movie and the volume of eWOM is not the factor that let the audiences go to the theater. 
Third, the eWOM effects on the revenue that we verify are not equally applied to all movies. 
In the case of the successful movie, the audiences have a lot of sources to get the information if the movie is what they like or not. 
Nowadays we are easily exposed to Facebook, Twitter, You Tube, online community, offline community, newspaper, and etc. 
The more successful movies are, the more information we can get. 
It means that we don’t have to check out the eWOM information if it is successful movie. 
But if it is unsuccessful, we have little information about the movie except eWOM on the portal website. 
The results explains that there is no statistically significant eWOM effect on the revenue in the successful movie which earn the top 50% revenue in the sample movie and eWOM effect on the unsuccessful movie was the same as the first result in the full sample. 
The results of this study imply that the film industry needs to recognize electronic WOM as an important channel for customer communication and manage it more efficiently especially if the movies are expected to be unsuccessful. 
Many companies are investing large amounts of their budget into customer communication costs, and have put effort into improving the awareness of their films, effectively using mass communication in traditional marketing and promotion activities. 
However, as this study shows that the valence of the WOM regarding a film influences its box-office revenue throughout the full term of its release, focusing more marketing Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 resources on WOM could prove more efficient than the very costly advertisement campaigns to raise awareness prior to film release. 
This could be achieved, in one way, by gathering customer feedback in screenings and focusing marketing efforts on groups that show high levels of WOM activity. 
However, the validity of the results of this study might be limited to South Korean data, and whether the same applies to data from other countries is a subject for further research. 
Also future studies should perform analysis taking into account the fact that the volume and valence of WOM can differ greatly according to the targeted audience of a film.
