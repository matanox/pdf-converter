HIGHLIGHTS • We found that 50% of the participants chose to use the preemptive attack option for no personal gain. 
• The option was rarely used when the opponent did not have a capability of preemptive attack. 
• Thus, the preemptive attack was fear-based, not involving the goal of hurting the opponent. 
• The frequency of the option use was not affected by the minimal group membership of the opponent.

Introduction Following a 2002 speech at West Point, the administration of thenPresident George W. Bush adopted a new emphasis on pre-emption in their National Security Strategy, stating that “[t]he greater the threat, the greater the risk of inaction—and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves” (The White House, 2002). 
The Bush doctrine was implemented the following year when the US invaded Iraq with the stated purpose of destroying the threat of mass destruction posed by the latter. 
In the wake of 9/11, a substantial majority of Americans supported this preemptive strike, despite the lack of clear reasons for a potential attack on the US (Eichenberg, Stoll, & Lebo, 2006). 
In the current study, we examined how likely people are to engage in this type of defensive aggression even in the absence of incentives for either party to attack the other. 
For this purpose, we designed the preemptive strike game (PSG), a two-person economic game in which neither player has an incentive to attack the other, insofar as both players are rational and assume that the other is rational. In this game, each player is given an option to press a button before the other player presses it. Pressing the button involves some monetary cost. The player who presses the button ﬁrst imposes monetary costs on the opponent, which are greater than those incurred by the player who presses the button. 
The gist of this game is that a ﬁrst strike secures a player from enduring further aggression from his/her opponent. 
Once one of the players presses the button, the other player cannot retaliate by pressing the button in response. 
Reasons for engaging in a preemptive strike in this situation is a player's spiteful preference (Falk, Fehr, & Fischbacher, 2005) or a belief that the other party is irrational, stupid, confused, or has a spiteful preference (Andreoni, 1995; Schelling, 1980). 
The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate that the mere presence of an interaction partner capable of attacking a given player is sufﬁcient for the latter to engage in a preemptive attack. 
This goal was achieved in Study 1, which demonstrated that a substantial proportion of our participants engaged in a preemptive attack when their interaction partner had the capability to attack them, w hile they did not do so when their partner did not have such capability. 
The second goal of this study was t o examine whether this type of defensive aggression would be aggravated in an inter-group situation, as opposed to a ☆This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

s ituation. 
As a ﬁrststeptowardaddressingthesecond issue, we conducted a minimal group e xperiment in Study 2 t o see if group membership affected the frequency of the preemptive attack. 
Previous research has found evidence that members of the in-group show greater spite toward the out-group than the in-group (Bernhard, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2006); this has been observed even when the groups were formed on the basis of meaningless criteria and without any prior interaction or shared interests between the group members (called minimal groups; Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, & Flament, 1971). 
Given the standard interpretation of in-group bias in minimal group experiments, we expected relatively stronger spite-based behavior against out-group members than in-group members. 
Furthermore, previous research has found positive in-group bias and negative out-group bias in the judgment of members' personal qualities (Brewer, 1979; Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002). 
It is likely that this bias reduces an individual's anticipation of attack from in-group members and/or enhances fear of attack from out-group members, leading to the prediction that defensive aggression would be weaker when the opponent is an ingroup member, rather than an out-group member. 
An alternative interpret ation of in- group bias in minim al group expe riments from the interdependence theoretic perspective (Mifune, Hashimoto, & Yamagishi, 2010; Yamagishi & Mifune, 2008, 2009) predicts no group difference in spite-based aggression against the outgroup. 
According to the proponents of the interdependence theoretic perspective, in-group bias represents a means o f enhancin g the player's reputation as a person deserving favors f rom members of his/her group. 
Yamagishi and co lle agues (e.g., Horit a & Y amagishi, 2010; Jin & Yamagishi, 1997; Kiyonari, 2002; Yamagishi & Mifune, 2008, 2009) conducted a series of experiments in which participants behaved more cooperatively or altr uistically toward in-group member s than outgroup members wh en , and only when , they were identiﬁed by i ngroup members as members of the same group. 
In contrast, no group difference was observed when participants knew that their partners were in-group members who were, how ever, unaware of the partic ipant's membership. 
These ﬁndings have been interpreted to show that stronger spite a gainst the out-group is not the main motivational basi s for the ingroup bias observed in m inima l group studies; rather, i nter-group aggression is considered a by-product o f in-group cooperation particularly in situations in w hich the la tter requir es negative s ide effects for the out-group (Halevy, Bornstein, & Sagiv, 2008). 
Sin ce the PSG invo lves n o in-group cooperation, there is no r eason for participants to act i n a manner that f avor s the in-group. 
T his is also t rue for members of the outgroup; thus, there is no reason to be afraid of an attack occurring as a r esult of in-group cooperation among members of the out-grou p. On this basis, there could be no fear-based in-group b ias too. 
W e tested th e two alternative hypotheses mentioned above by using the PSG i n which participants faced an in-group or out-group opponent. 
Study 1: Bilateral and unilateral preemptive strike games In the PSG used in our study, p articipants chose between two options: 1) press a red button displayed on the computer screens, or 2) take no action. 
Their de cisions w ere made in r eal time a nd only o nce. 
If neith er player pressed t he red button during t he a llotted time (60 s), they bot h w alked away with the highe st possible payoff, JPY 1500. 
If one of the players pressed the button, he/she paid JPY 100, while the other player paid an even higher amount, JPY 1000, and l ost his/her ability to p ress the button. 
Insofarastheplayersinthisgamearerationalmaximizersoftheir own money, the only motive to press the button is self-defense against a potential threat of aggression from the opponent. 
However, it is possible for the players to be motivated by spite. 
In other words, participants m ay press the button to ensure t heir dominance over anoth er per son b y harming the other play er's relative standing in the game. 
In St udy 1, w e compared a unilateral condition of t he PSG to the original (bilateral) game to demonstrate that the attacks occurring in the PSG were not motivated by spite. 
In the unilateral condition, the red button was presented to only one of the two players, leaving the other player without the option to press the button. 
This manipulation rids the “powerful player” of a reason to anticipate an aggressive action from his/her opponent and, as a result, provides no reason f or this player to act out of self-defense. 
Procedure Participants Eighty-four students from Hokkaido University (34 female) participated in 16 experimental sessions, with eight participants per session. 
Thirty-two participants (13 female) took part in the bilateral PSG; 26 of these (11 female) took on the role of the decider, who was provided with the red button in the unilateral PSG, and 26 participants (10 female) took on the role of the predictor, who did not have any button and simply predicted the decider's choice. 
The predictors' data from the unilateral condition were not used for analysis. 
Because the nature of the experiment required an even number of participants, a confederate was used in cases of cancelation. 
The confederate's choice in the bilateral condition did not affect the matched participant's choice because his/her decisions were not revealed until the end of the game. 
The confederates were assigned the role of predictor in the unilateral condition. 
PSG The participant faced a computer surrounded by partitions that prevented others in the room from seeing him/her. 
Participants were told that they would be randomly paired with one other person from the room, who would remain unknown to them. 
The instructions also stated that the game would be played only once. 
After the participants completed a practice session following the instructions, the experimenter announced the beginning of the game. 
Participants were given a 5-second countdown before the 60-second game began. 
Feedback about the outcome of the game was given after expiry of the allocated time. 
We analyzed whether each participant pressed the red button, regardless of whether he/she did so before his/her partner did. 
In the case of both players pressing the button, payment was decided on the basis of who pressed the button ﬁrst. Hypothetical PSG After completing the game, participants took part in an additional hypothetical experiment in which they were told to imagine a situation where they faced the same game. 
They were further informed that they would have an additional “blue” button. 
They could press the red button, the blue button, or neither. 
Pressing the red button had the same effect as in the real experiment. 
Pressing the blue button reduced both players' respective rewards by JPY 100 and disabled further attacks, without imposing the loss of JPY 1000 on the other player. 
If players only sought to defend themselves against a possible attack, they would opt for pressing the blue button. 
Results PSG In the bilateral condition, 16 of the 32 participants (50%) pressed the red button, while only 1 of the 26 participants acting as deciders in the unilateral condition did so (Fig. 1). The difference between the conditions was statistically signiﬁcant (χ 2 [1, N =58]=14.57,p b .01). 
All of the participants who pressed the red button in the bilateral condition did so within the ﬁrst second of the game. 
This ﬁnding suggests that the participants who pressed the button did so with a clear understanding of the implications of their actions, as it would be logical to press the red button as quickly as possible. 
The sole attacker in the unilateral condition pressed the button 53.8 s into the game. 
Hypothetical PSG The results of the hypothetical experiment conﬁrmed th at the overwhelming majority of the participants who pressed the button 1121D. 
Simunovic et al. / Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 49 (2013) 1120–1123 (“attackers”) did so as a measure of self-defense, rather than spite. 
That is, 13 of the 16 attackers op ted t o press the blue button r ather t han the re d button, while 2 opted to press n either button, a nd only 1 pressed the red button. 
Four of the sixteen non-attackers opted to press t he blue button, and none of them opted to press the red button. 
These results suggest that only one participant in the real experiment pressed the red button out of spite, whereas the others did so as a m eans of self-defense. 
Study 2: Minimal groups We followed up Study 1 with a PSG in which participants were assigned to minimal groups. 
Procedure A total of 132 students took part in 14 experimental sessions, with 6 to 10 participants per session. 
They were ﬁrst asked to participate in the picture preference task. 
They were shown 28 pairs of pictures by either Paul Klee or Wassily Kandinsky and asked to choose which picture they liked more in each pair. 
Participants were then assigned either to the Klee group or the Kandinsky group on the basis of their preferences for the two artists, and subsequently answered identity scales assessing the strength of in-group and out-group identiﬁcation (Grieve & Hogg, 1999). 
They were then randomly assigned to either the in-group condition or the out-group condition, and played the PSG either with a member of the same group or the other group. 
As in Study 1, participants took part in an additional hypothetical experiment with the option of a blue button. 
A confederate was used in the case of a cancelation. 
Results Manipulation check Participants' mean level of identiﬁcation with the i n-group (M = 4.28, SD = 1.16) was signiﬁcantly stronger than that with the outgroup ( M = 4.07, SD = 1.03; t(131) = 2.43, p b .05). 
This result conﬁrm s that our minimal group manipulation was effective. 
PSG Of the 132 participants, 40 (30.3%) pressed the red button; there was no signiﬁcant difference between the in-group and the out-group conditions (χ 2 [1, N =132]=.18,p = .67), with 29% of the 73 participants in the in-group condition and 32% of the 59 pa rticipants in the out-group condition pressing the red button (Fig. 2). Of the 40 attackers, 37 did so within the ﬁrst second of the game; an additional three attacked at 1.3, 2.1, and 4.7 s, respectively. 
Hypothetical PSG The results of the hypothetical experiment conﬁrmed that the overwhelming majority of the attackers in the real experiment opted to press either the blue button (76% of the attackers in the in-group condition, 68% in the out-group condition) or neither button (14% in the ingroup condition, 21% in the out-group condition). 
Only 2 of the 21 attackers in the in-group condition and 2 of the 19 attackers in the out-group condition pressed the red button. 
None of the non-attackers pressed the red button (Fig. 2). Overall discussion Intergroup aggression has traditionally been treated as a form of affective or predatory aggression, but defensive aggression, such as the preemptive attack in the current PSG study, does not fully correspond with either type of aggression (Berkowitz, 1993; McElliskem, 20 04). 
The overwhelming majority of participants who acted aggressively (i.e., imposed harm on the other participant) in the current study did not desire to harm the opponent, as shown by the fact that most of them opted for the more benign blue button when this option was available. 
The act of a preemptive strike was thus found to be a means of selfdefense, based on the fear of being attacked ﬁrst. While fear has been traditionally lin k ed to ﬂight rather than ﬁght (cf., Cannon, 1932), the ﬁnding that approximately half of the participants engaged in the preemptive strike option for no personal gain highlights the role that the “benign,” defensive form of aggression plays in inter-individual and inter-group conﬂict. 
In fact, defensive aggression can produce consequences as serious as those triggered by spiteful aggression, as exempliﬁed by the role played by the support for the Bush Doctrine in swaying Americans toward supporting the Iraq War. 
Although the current study found no group difference in defensive aggression insofar as minimal groups are concerned, the role of fear in instigating intergroup aggression has been demonstrated in earlier studies (Bar-Tal, 2001; De Dreu et al., 2010). 
Furthermore, it has been noted that the role played by fear, in addition to greed, in inter-group conﬂict is stronger in group-level decisions, as compared to individual decisions (Insko, Schopler, Hoyle, Dardis, & Graetz, 1990; Schopler et al., 1993;seeWildschut, Pinter, Ve vea, Insko, & Schopler, 2003,fora review). 
This suggests that the fear of being attacked by an opponent could be stronger when the opponent is a group, rather than an Fig. 1. The number of participants (by condition) who attacked or did not attack in Study 1 (left), and the number of decisions to press the red or blue button, or neither, in the hypothetical experiment in Study 1 (right).

1122 D. Simunovic et al. / Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 49 (2013) 1120–1123 individual. Thus, it is possible that the preemptive strike in the PSG occurs more frequently in a group-level decision than in an individual decision. 
The absence of group bias in our study could be due to the fact that we studied the effect at the individual level, or that the PSG was played in a negative domain where in-group bias is known to be rare (Brewer, 1979; Mummendey & Otten, 1998). 
Therefore, in the future, it is important to study whether preemptive attacks against the outgroup increase when the decision is made by the group, rather than the individual. The ﬁndings from the current study will serve as a baseline for evaluating the possible roles of additional factors, including the individual–group discontinuity effect, in future research.
