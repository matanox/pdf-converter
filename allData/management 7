INTRODUCTION The concept and study of SST has gained wide spread interest in recent years (Beatson, Lee, and Coote, 2007; Dean, 2008; Forbes, 2008; Makarem, Mudambi, and Podoshen, 2009; Kelly, Lawlor, and Mulvey, 2010). 
The proliferation of new self-service technology (SST) found in the retail environment today suggests a need to assess the extent to which consumers are willing to actually use this new technology. 
A general conclusion from previous research is that the adoption of SST is driven by technology characteristics and individual differences. 
SST is likely to become increasingly more important because it allows retailers to standardize their interaction with consumers (Hsieh, Yen, and Chin, 2004), to increase productivity and efficiency (Walker, Craig-Lees, Hecker, and Francis, 2002), and to offer consumers access to services through new and convenient channels (Meuter, Ostrom, Bitner, and Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Roundtree, 2003). 
SST also allows consumers to be productive resources involved in the service delivery, thus allowing retailers to handle demand fluctuations without expensive adjustment of employee levels (Curran, Meuter, and Surprenant, 2003). 
Self-scanning checkouts in grocery stores is one type of SST that when first introduced over two decades ago was initially not well received by consumers. 
This resistance may have been due to consumers’ lack of trust and confidence in themselves and in the new technology to perform correctly. 
Today, however, self-scanning technology is very popular and has grown beyond grocery stores, with self-scanning checkout/check-in kiosks found today in airports, movie theaters, and libraries. 
The modern consumer is seemingly more technologically informed and comfortable with using self-scanning technology. 
One of the nation’s largest grocery stores, Kroger Co. is currently testing a new advanced self-checkout system (Gasparro, 2011). 
This new technology, which is a scan-tunnel system, is similar to what airlines use for carry-on luggage. 
Customers place their grocery items on a conveyor belt and the tunnel scans the barcodes regardless of which direction they are facing. 
Initial results are encouraging as customers appear to be embracing the scan tunnels, and the new technology has the potential to reduce theft but still allow for employee interaction by bagging the groceries and manning the scan tunnels. 
Given the expanding role and importance of self-scanning technology in the retail setting, it is imperative to enhance the understanding of factors that may affect consumers’ evaluation and intention to use self-scanning technology. 
The purpose of this paper is to extend recent research that has investigated factors driving consumers’ usage of self-scanning technology. 
Specifically, this study assesses the impact of consumer differences (i.e., technology readiness) and SST attributes (i.e., perceived reliability and perceived fun) on consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology to complete a retail transaction. 
LITERATURE REVIEW Self-Scanning Technology Meuter, Ostrom, Roundtree, and Bitner (2000) first defined SST as “technological interfaces that enable consumers to produce a service independent of direct service employee involvement.” The increasing use of SST by retailers has created a growing need for classifying different types of SST. 
Meuter et al. (2000) introduced a classification of SST along two dimensions: 1) interface (telephone/interactive voice response; online/internet; interactive kiosks; video/CD) and 2) purpose (customer service; transactions; self-help). 
Cunningham, Young, and Gerlach (2008) also classified SST along two dimensions: 1) standardized vs. customized, and 2) separable vs. inseparable. 
Standardized includes pay at the pump, Internet search, self-scanning, and tax software. 
Customized includes online education and online brokerage services. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 The importance of one type of SST, self-scanning technology, has grown significantly in retailing seemingly because of its potential strategic value. 
The appeal of self-scanning technology is primarily derived from the elimination of a service representative. 
Retailers are drawn to self-checkout because of its promise of greater cost efficiencies, enhanced service quality, and attraction of new customers over in-person services (Parasuraman and Grewal, 2000). 
The use of self-scanning technology does not always lead to positive consumer attitudes or consumer usage. 
To encourage greater use of self-checkout/check-in, some firms are trying to force consumers into using the technology by charging additional fees for using the traditional full-service transaction. 
However, Reinders, Dabholkar, and Frambach (2008) argue that forcing consumers to use technology based self-service has severe and adverse effects on attitudes both toward using the SST and toward the service provider. 
Restricted freedom leads to frustration and hostile attitudes toward the source of the restriction, in this case the service provider (Fitzsimons and Lehmann, 2004). 
The negative attitudes resulting from forced use of SST can include: 1) an increase in negative word-of-mouth about the service provider, and 2) a loss of customers to competition. 
Weijters, Rangarajan, Falk, and Schillewaert (2007) investigated consumer usage of selfscanning technology in grocery stores in Western Europe. 
The authors identified a model to better understand the antecedents and consequences of self-scanning usage by customers in a retail setting. 
As part of their study, they found perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived reliability, and perceived fun to be key drivers of consumer attitudes toward selfscanning usage. 
Wang, Harris, and Patterson (2009) also found that situational influences (waiting time, task complexity, and group influence) may impact an individual’s choice of selfcheckout usage. 
One potential risk faced by firms using self-scanning options is reduced customer loyalty. 
Selnes and Hansen (2001) suggested that self-service without minimal personal interaction may have a negative effect on consumer loyalty because the important social-bond element is removed. 
The authors also argued that personal service and personal relationships between customers and employees are even more important in maintaining customer loyalty when simple and repetitive tasks are automated. 
Beatson, et al. (2007) found similar results regarding the potential negative impact self-scanning may have on customer satisfaction and resulting customer commitment. 
Some grocery stores, such as Albertson’s, have recently announced they are removing the self-service checkouts in their stores to enhance the one-on-one interaction with customers (Gasparro, 2011). 
Conceptual Model Figure 1 represents the proposed conceptual model regarding consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology (IU). 
Based on theoretical underpinnings supported in prior research, Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 this model theorizes that consumer technology readiness has a positive influence on perceived reliability and perceived fun of SST. 
In addition, technology readiness, perceived reliability of SST, and perceived fun of SST usage are also hypothesized to be a casual determinant of IU. Technology Readiness Technology readiness (TR) refers to an individual’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies for accomplishing goals in home life and at work (Parasuraman, 2000). 
TR is a state of mind, resulting from mental enablers and inhibitors that collectively determine a person’s predisposition to use new technology (Parasuraman, 2000). 
Meuter et al. (2003) suggested that 55% of Americans suffer from some degree of technophobia. 
In other words, many individuals avoid technology if they are not comfortable with, or not ready to use the technology. 
TR has been commonly assessed through the use of the Technology Readiness Index (TRI), which is a 36-item measurement scale developed by Parasuraman (2000) that assesses four dimensions of TR. According to the TRI, two dimensions of TR are contributors and two are inhibitors of technology adoption. 
The contributors to technology adoption are: 1) Optimism – the degree to which individuals believe that technology can benefit their lives and give them more control, flexibility, and efficiency in their lives, and 2) Innovativeness – a natural desire to experiment with new technologies, as well as to be a thought leader. 
The inhibitors to Intention to Use SelfScanning Technology Readiness Perceived Reliability of SST Perceived Fun of SST Figure 1 Proposed Self-Scanning Model Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 technology adoption are: 1) Discomfort – a feeling of lacking both control over technology and the confidence in making the technology work, and 2) Insecurity – a need for assurance that a technology-based product, service or process will operate reliably and accurately. 
The TRI reflects a set of beliefs about technology, but is not an indicator of an individual’s competency in using the technology. 
The TRI can be used to assess TR for employees within a firm, as well as for the firm’s customers. 
The TRI has been found to be a valid indicator of TR across various cultures (Tsikriktsis, 2004; Jaafar, Aziz, Ramayah, and Saad, 2007; Meng, Elliott, and Hall, 2010). 
Findings on the impact of TR on perceptions and intentions towards using SST are scarce and conflicting. 
Lin and Hsieh (2006; 2007) found increased customer TR leads to favorable behavioral intentions when using SST, and argued that firms should pay special attention to TR in order to improve favorable outcomes of SST implementation. 
However, Liljander, Gillberg, Gummerus, and Riel (2007), found that TR had little impact on consumers’ adoption behavior of SST. 
Similarly, Lin, Shih, and Sher (2007) found a non-significant relationship between consumer TR and their intentions to use a specific e-service. 
These limited and confounding results suggests a need to further investigate the impact TR has on usage intentions for specific SST. 
Therefore, the following hypothesis is presented: H1 TR has a positive and direct effect on consumers’ intention to use selfscanning technology (IU). 
Perceived Reliability Of Sst Perceived reliability of SST (PR) refers to the correct technical functioning of technology. 
PR is critical to any retail transaction using SST. 
PR can reduce a consumer’s anxiety and perceived risk of using SST to complete retail transactions. 
We have found no studies specifically investigating the effect of TR on PR. Walczuch and Lundgren (2004) concluded that knowledge and experience with the Internet did play a limited role in influencing trust in using e-retailing. 
In other words, the more an individual uses the Internet and knows how e-retailers operate, the more confident that individual will feel that e-retailing technology will work correctly for them. 
Given the need for further research on the influence TR has on PR, and the suggestion of Parasuraman (2000) to examine the consequences of TR, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2 TR has a positive and direct effect on perceived reliability of SST (PR). 
Limited research exists regarding the impact of PR on IU. Dabholkar, Bobbitt, and Lee (2003) argue that PR does have a positive impact on IU. Their findings, however, were based on a small sample size (n = 49). 
Weijters et al. (2007) found PR to be a determinant of a Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 consumer’s “attitude” towards usage of SST. 
Similarly, Dabholkar and Bagozzi (2002) proposed perceived performance as being a determinant of attitude towards using SST. 
Drawing on the insights from these earlier studies, the following hypothesis is proposed: H3 PR has a direct and positive effect on consumers’ intention to use selfscanning technology (IU). 
Perceived Fun of SST Perceived fun of SST (PF) focuses on the enjoyment aspect of using technology. 
Enjoyment or fun refers to the extent to which the activity of using technology is perceived to provide reinforcement in its own right, apart from any performance consequences that may be anticipated (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw, 1989). 
We also have found no studies investigating specifically the effect of TR on PF. Lin et al. (2007) found that a consumer’s TR did positively impact consumer satisfaction with SST. 
The authors described satisfaction as a judgment by the consumer that the product or service feature provided a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfillment. 
Again, given the need for further research on the influence TR has on PF, the following hypothesis is presented: H4 TR has a positive and direct effect on perceived fun of SST (PF). 
PF has been found to be a dominant factor in influencing both relationship duration and repurchase intention as it relates to online shopping (Bauer, Falk, and Hammerschmidt, 2006). 
PF has also been found to be an important determinant of attitude toward the use of technology (Davis et al. 1989, 1992; Dabholkar et al., 2002; and Weijters et al. 2007). 
In keeping with this theoretical argument, the following hypothesis is proposed: H5 PF has a direct and positive effect on consumers’ intention to use selfscanning technology (IU). 
METHODOLOGY Data Collection An online survey was developed to collect data using Zoomerang’s online consumer panel. 
Panel members were randomly selected to receive email invitations with Zoompoints as incentives for their participation. 
Respondents self-selected, and a total of 1,079 consumers chose to participate in the survey by responding to the email invitation. 
The sample was comprised of 48.4% male and 51.6% female respondents. 
In addition, 48.7% were married, and Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 75.2% had received some education after high school. 
Age groupings were 18 to 20 (4.2%), 21 to 30 (22.5%), 31 to 40 (20.1%), 41 to 50 (20.7%), and over 50 (32.5%). 
Finally, 28.1% of respondents reported annual household income under $25,000, 18.8% reported income from $25,000 to $34,999, 16.3% reported income from $35,000 to $49,999, 18.0% reported income from $50,000 to $74,999, 10.1% reported income from $75,000 to $99,999, and 8.6% reported annual household income over $100,000. 
Measurement of Constructs The questionnaire began with the 36 items that comprise the TRI Scale (Parasuraman, 2000). 
The second part of the questionnaire included three items that assessed PR, two items that evaluated PF, and a single item that assessed IU. The final section of the questionnaire assessed demographic characteristics of respondents. 
A pretest of the on-line questionnaire revealed no problems with regard to respondent interpretation of the questions and data tabulation. 
The internal consistency of the scales was tested through the computation of Cronbach alpha values. 
Calculated alphas of .891 (technology readiness), .803 (perceived reliability), and .886 (perceived fun) were all deemed adequate for use in the conduct of basic research (Nunnally, 1978). 
Data Analysis Both proposed measurement and structural models were tested using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). 
Three types of information were considered in assessing model fit in both cases: chi-square, measurement error, and fit indices. 
Given that chi-square values tend to be sensitive to sample size and are likely to be significant if large datasets are utilized, chi-square is not an absolute criterion in evaluating model fit. 
A second criterion that was examined was measurement error, or RMSEA (root-mean-square error of approximation). 
The final piece of evidence examined were the fit indices of CFI (Comparative Fit Index), IFI (Incremental Fit Index), NFI (Normed Fit Index), and NNFI (Non-Normed Fit Index). 
RESULTS Test Of Measurement Model The TRI (Parasuraman, 2000) was used to assess TR. Items which had non-significant and/or low factor loadings on the TR construct were deleted from the model. 
A 13-item construct was selected as the optimal solution for the measurement of TR, with the reliability of the TR construct improving slightly to .911. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 The three item scale measuring PR and the two item scale evaluating PF were measurement items used in previous research (Dabholkar et al. 2002; Weijters et al. 2007). 
The single item scale assessing IU was designed specifically for this study (i.e., “In the future, how likely is it that you would use self-scanning technology if it were available at the store in which you are shopping?” The path loadings for the proposed measurement model are shown in Table 1. All path coefficients were significant at the .01 level, with the majority of loadings above .50, indicating high validity for the proposed measurement model.

.65 Perceived Fun of SST (PF) .886 Self-scanning will be entertaining. 
.82 Self-scanning will be enjoyable. 
.96 The results for assessing the fit of the proposed measurement model are shown in Table 2. The chi-square statistic of 2739.38 was significant at 153 Degrees of Freedom (p<.000). 
Other fit indices, however, all demonstrate a good model fit. 
The fit indices of CFI, IFI, NFI, and NNFI were all reasonably high at .91, .91, .90, and .90 respectively. 
In addition, the RMSEA was low at .13, therefore, the generalizability of the measurement model was accepted and assumed valid.

The LISREL output for assessing the fit of the structural model is presented in Table 3. The overall model fit was again assessed through chi-square, error level (RMSEA), and multiple fit indices (CFI, IFI, NFI and NNFI). 
Although the chi-square statistic of 1863.91 was significant at 148 degrees of freedom (p<.000), the multiple fit indices were all above the 0.90 level, and the RMSEA was relatively low at .11, all indicating an acceptable fit between the hypothesized model and the data.

As the results in Table 4 indicate, TR does significantly impact PR and PF, but not IU. Therefore, H2 and H4 were supported, but not H1. In addition, the hypothesized positive influences of PR and PF on IU were confirmed, thus H3 and H5 were also supported. 
All path coefficients of supported hypotheses were significant at the .001 level.

(2007) also found a non-significant relationship between TR and consumers’ intention to SST, but did find the SST attributes of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to fully mediate the effects between TR and consumers’ intention to use SST. 
Given these findings, and the theoretical underpinnings that support the justification for a hypothesized link between TR and IU, further analysis was conducted to assess if the SST attributes of PR and PF mediate the impact of TR on IU. Therefore, the following two hypotheses are proposed: H6 Perceived reliability of SST (PR) mediates the effect of TR on consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology (IU). 
H7 Perceived fun of SST (PF) mediates the effect of TR on consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology (IU). 
The test for mediation effect was conducted using guidelines presented by Baron and Kenny (1986). 
First, when regressing the mediator on the independent variable, the independent variable must significantly affect the mediator. 
Next, when regressing the dependent variable on the independent variable, the independent variable must significantly affect the dependent variable. 
Finally, when regressing the dependent variable on both the independent variable and the mediator, the mediator must significantly affect the dependent variable. 
To establish mediation, the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the third regression test than in the second. 
This study also used the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982) to confirm if the mediation path was significant. 
Table 5 summarizes the results of the mediation tests. 
Table 5: Mediation Tests for Perceived Reliability and Perceived Fun of SST Dependent Variables Perceived Reliability (PR) Intention to Use (IU) Intention to Use (IU) Perceived Fun (PF) Intention to Use (IU) Intention to Use (IU) TR .016*(10.39) .069*(11.73) .040*(7.33) .019*(10.35) .069*(11.73) .041*(7.49) PR 1.797*(17.96) PF 1.466*(16.99) Sobel Test z=7.31* z=8.29* Notes: t-value in parentheses; * significant at p < .001 The results in Table 5 confirm that TR significantly affects PR and IU, respectively. 
For the meditation effect of PR to hold, the effect of TR on IU must be reduced when PR is controlled, while the effect of PR on IU must be significant. 
As shown in Table 5, the effect of Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 TR on IU was reduced from .069 to .040 with t-value reduced from 11.73 to 7.33, and the effect of PR on IU was significant. 
Moreover, the Sobel test (z = 7.31, p < .001) confirmed that the mediation effect of PR does exist, therefore, confirming H6. When the effect of TR was reduced, its effect was still significant when PR was controlled. 
This finding show PR only partially mediates the path between TR and IU, suggesting that other mediators may exist. The findings in Table 5 show similar results for the mediating effect of PF. The effect of TR on IU was reduced from .069 to .041 with t-value reduced from 11.73 to 7.49, and the effect of PF on IU was significant. 
Again, the Sobel test (z = 8.29, p < .001) confirmed that the mediation effect of PF does exist, thus H7 was supported. 
Test of Trimmed Model Since the results in Table 4 indicated a non-significant relationship between TR and IU, the structural model was further estimated by trimming the path between TR and IU. Thus, the trimmed model and the original full model were nested, and the two models were compared based on the difference between their chi-square statistics (see Table 6). Table 6: Trimmed Versus Full Model Trimmed Model Full Model Path Path Coefficients Path Coefficients TR->PR .91* (11.07) .91* (11.04) TR->PF .82* (10.55) .81* (10.49) TR->IU .06 (.79) PR->IU .41* (12.65) .40* (10.94) PF->IU .43* (12.55) .42* (11.16) Model Fit Statistics Chi square (d.f.) 1864.62* (149) 1863.91* (148) CFI .94 .94 IFI .94 .94 NFI .93 .93 NNFI .93 .93 RMSEA .11 .11 Note: * p < .001 As shown in Table 6, the trimmed model yielded an x 2 of 1864.62 (149), and did not deteriorate significantly (∆x 2 = .71, ∆d.f. = 1, p = .23). 
Moreover, the relationships of TR Æ PF, PR Æ IU, and PF ÆIU were all slightly stronger in the trimmed model than in the full model. 
Therefore, the overall results in Table 6 indicate that the trimmed model (without the TR Æ IU path) is the preferred model. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS This study extends previous research related to TR. Specifically, this study examined the impact of TR on consumers’ perceptions of SST attributes, as well as the impact on consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology. 
Previous studies have examined the influence TR has on the SST attributes of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Lin et al., 2007; Walczuch, Lemmink, and Streukens, 2007). 
There currently, however, is a gap in the literature related to the investigation of TR and its impact on other SST attributes, such as perceived reliability and perceived fun. 
An important finding of this current study is that TR does have a direct and positive influence on both perceived reliability and perceived fun of SST. 
Another important finding of this study is the seemingly minor direct role TR plays in predicting consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology to complete a retail transaction. 
The results of this study show that consumers’ perceived reliability and perceived fun of SST appear to be more important drivers of intention to use self-scanning technology than TR, as both constructs were found to have a direct and positive effect on consumers’ intention to use selfscanning technology. 
Perceived reliability and perceived fun of SST were also found to partially mediate the effect of TR on intention to use self-scanning technology. 
This finding helps to explain the non-significant path found between TR and IU, as well as sheds light on why consumers who score high on TR do not always use self-scanning options in the retail environment. 
Other factors, such as perceptions related to the SST (i.e., low perceived reliability, lack of enjoyment), or simply the desire to interact with store employees may dominate the decision to use or not use self-scanning technology. 
Important managerial implications can be derived from the findings of this study. 
First, retail managers must ensure that self-scanning technology is dependable and functioning correctly (e.g., reliable). 
Some consumers may seek to avoid self-scanning options because of their lack of confidence in, and understanding of, the self-scanning technology. 
Therefore, educating consumers on how to use self-scanning technology is critical. Airlines have been successful in educating consumers on how to use check-in kiosks by having employees show them how the kiosks work. 
Moreover, employees should also be trained to promptly and patiently help customers solve problems when they encounter troubles in using self-scanning technologies. 
This will encourage customers to try and assure them a more reliable and less stressful experience in using self-scanning technologies. 
Creating some aspect of enjoyment/fun from using the self-scanning technology also appears to be imperative. 
Bauer et al. (2006) point out the importance of hedonic aspects in technology-dominated retail settings. 
The use of self-scanning technology, in part, is seemingly driven by the anticipated enjoyment received from using the technology. 
Innovative technology should be used that is aesthetically appealing, and that uses state-of-the art audio and visual effects. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Although this study did provide additional insight into the influence TR has on the evaluation of SST attributes and consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology, a number of limitations do exist. First, our findings were obtained from a single study. 
Therefore, caution must be exercised when generalizing the results to the entire consuming population. 
Second, we used a single determinant (TR) of perceived reliability and perceived fun of SST. 
However, there are a number of other factors (i.e., quality, trust, complexity, social influence, etc.) that could also impact the evaluation of these SST attributes. 
We also used a single item scale to assess intention to use self-scanning technology. 
Finally, even though the sample size in this study was relatively large, respondent participation was based on self-selection, and as a result, some selection bias could exist within the sample. 
Future research should focus on the influence TR has on consumer perceptions of SST attributes across different individual characteristics and different cultures. 
Additional research is also needed to investigate the impact situational variables, such as perceived waiting time, the availability of customer assistance if needed, and the presence of other customers on consumers’ intention to use self-scanning technology. 
Finally, future research could expand upon the current findings by examining the role played by specific dimensions of TR (i.e., optimism, discomfort, etc.) in explaining consumers’ intentions to use self-scanning technology to complete a retail transaction.
