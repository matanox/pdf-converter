INTRODUCTION Social media, defined as “a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of User Generated Content” (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010), has grown explosively and become very popular in recent years, thanks to the advances in diverse Web 2.0 technologies. 
Social media platforms provide various SNSs (Social Network Services) which attract hundreds of millions of users worldwide. 
According to ComScore, as of October 2011, 1.2 billion users are enjoying SNSs around the world and 98% of online users in the US are using social media (ComScore, 2011a). 
More specifically, Facebook had 845 million active users at the end of December 2011 Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 (Facebook, 2012). 
Twitter hit 100 million active users in 2011 (Twitter, 2012) and an estimate of registered Twitter accounts reached 500 million in February 2012 (Twopcharts, 2012). 
In addition, the average time spent on social media is increasing steadily, especially among young people. 
Online users were spending 19% of all time spent on the web in October 2011, in contrast with 6% in March 2007 (ComScore, 2011a). 
Millennials who were born between 1981 and 2000 spent 41% of online time on Facebook in September 2011 (ComScore, 2011b). 
Social media help users build social relationship by connecting members or inviting even non-members. 
Users can interact with friends or meet new people in cyberspace. 
In addition, users as consumers can also express or exchange their views on products/services or organizations. 
Public and private organizations have also realized the importance of social media as a powerful tool for establishing relationships with citizens or consumers. 
They want to explore opportunities that leverage on the popularity of social media. 
McKinsey survey reported that 72% of executives from 4,200 companies responded that they used at least one social media platform (Bughin et al., 2011). 
Another survey result showed that 80% of companies use social media for recruitment in 2011 (Jobvite, 2011) while another survey revealed that 93% of marketers were employing social media for marketing (Stelzner, 2011). 
There are well known cases where companies or individuals have already embraced social media successfully. 
A pop singer has used social media to launch a new song and to strengthen his celebrity image (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2012). 
Likewise, an organization can build and strengthen its brand image or public relations. 
An organization can introduce a new product/service into the global market through social media, in addition to traditional mass media outlets. 
The Recording Academy implemented an integrated social media strategy for the 52 nd Grammy Awards in 2010 with huge success (Wesley and Rohm, 2010; Hanna et al., 2011). 
Although the potential benefits from social media could be enormous, organizations face challenges in taking advantage of social media, since the old way of managing traditional media does not work for social media and numerous social media platforms make the issue of managing social media complicated. 
There are at least six types of social media, such as collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia), blogs and microblogs (e.g., Twitter), content communities (e.g., YouTube), social networking sites (e.g., Facebook), virtual game worlds (e.g., World of Warcraft), and virtual social worlds (e.g. 
Second Life) (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2009). 
More and more organizations want to hire professionals in the area, as an attempt to manage and utilize social media effectively for their businesses or projects. 
Job titles commonly posted in the job market are Social Media Coordinator, Social Media Specialist, Social Media Manager, Online Community Manager, Public Relations Specialist, and so on (D’Angelo, 2010), although there are more than 80 job titles which involves the use of social media. 
The latest report by the US Department of Labor estimated the number of jobs Public Relations Specialists had in 2008 to be about 275,000 and projected jobs to grow over the next decade by 24%; a Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 much higher rate than other occupations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010). 
Universities need to prepare a special curriculum for students who want this job. 
The authors of this paper surveyed students at a business school about various aspects of social media. 
LITERATURE REVIEW Social Media in Marketing Social media is not new to marketing, but it is nonetheless an important tool. 
New emarketing tools and technologies have led to the development of new marketing strategies (Bradley 2011 and Luca 2011). 
One example as stated by Neff (2010) is that brands may often find more traffic on their Facebook site fan page than on their corporate website. 
Neff also stated that numerous brands use Facebook for relationship marketing making Facebook the largest such provider in that field. 
According to Finin, Joshi, Kolari, Java, Kale and Karandikar (2008), social media systems have become an “important way to transmit information, engage in discussions and form communities on the Internet. 
(p. 77). 
Corporations are striving to better understand the workings of social media systems and how to implement them because one-third of new web content represents such social media systems (Finen et al 2008). 
One area that social media tools have changed is marketing as communication has begun focusing individuals on personal connections, rather than on authorized spokespersons, and changing the opinion leader in the marketing realm (Gowdy, Hildebrand, La Piana and Campos 2009). 
The number of technologies entering the market on a constant basis keeps marketers extremely busy and presents an extreme challenge for marketing strategists. 
According to Jarvenpaa and Tuunaimen (2012), social media technologies (SMT) also are extremely helpful to marketers in that they “provide unparalleled opportunities for customer relationship management (CRM), which is extremely vital in the marketing world today. 
Girard and Bertsch stated that (2011), the use of social media tools has provided numerous benefits to marketers, in that emerging knowledge-sharing tools such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter “provide flexible, agile, and intuitive solutions for connecting people to people and facilitating coordination, communication and collaboration” (pg. 
98). 
There appears to be no end to the popularity of social media in the United States. 
According to Thomas (2010), “by the end of 2008, social networking had become more popular than email” (p. 1). Madden (2010) commented that in 2009 social media usage increased from 41% to 61% in those aged 18 and older. 
Social Media Coordinator Research has indicated that corporations, profit and non-profit, are using social media extensively and seek for well equipped Social Media Experts when searching for a Social Media Coordinator to add to their staff. 
Marquette University stated that they hired a Social Media Coordinator based on their story-telling experience, rather than their knowledge of current Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 technological skills. 
They stated that they also sought an individual who was up-to-date in their knowledge of new media and its relations to the social media market (Bosten 2011; Stageman 2009). 
According to Harris, Harrigan and Naudin (2010, pg. 2), employers within the current global marketplace are “seeking high level skills of communication, networking and entrepreneurship in their potential employees.” In addition, the skills consistently extend to social media usage through online methodology and engagement. 
Student Usage of Social Media Online social networking sites have grown considerably in the past few years. 
In addition, blogs, virtual communities and personal websites have continued with their popularity in the college student community to the point that such social media interaction has had a profound effect upon how students communicate with their peers (Mendez, Curry, Mivaveta, Kennedy, Weinland and Bainbridge 2009). 
In regards to Facebook, Pempek, Yermolayeva and Calvert (2009) commented that undergraduate students spend approximately 30 minutes per day on Facebook. 
According to Facebook.com data in 2011 this social media outlet had over 500 million active users. 
Twitter.com also echoes the importance of their place in social media with a statement that they feature 140 million tweets per day. 
These forms of social media have led to a figure of over 55% of young American youth who use internet on mobile devices. 
One study looked specifically at the social media usage of university business majors. 
Alexopoulos and Lynn (2010) found that business students, on average, own eight fixed or portable electronic devices. 
The researchers included 988 viable subjects within the study. 
When placing themselves on the Product Life Cycle, over 33% of the university student subjects labeled themselves as early adopters of technology. 
In the same study, the business students rated their favorite information communication technologies as Google, Moodle, Youtube, Linked In, Bebo and Facebook. 
The study also found that 84% of the university students asked were using a form of social media. 
McCool (2011) also stated the importance of Twitter to the college student because it provides the student with a sense of contact rarely seen in other forms of social media with celebrities and athletes. 
Employer Usage & Gap Analysis In addition to students, employers are also utilizing social media continuously. 
According to Maclenod (2008) Facebook is used by 56% of young business managers and that Generation Y members are definite fans of social media. 
Therefore, employers should seriously be using social media for numerous reasons, particularly employing Facebook, company blogs, Youtube, and virtual job boards for employee recruitment purposes. 
Han (2010) suggests that companies should continue to look for other social media platforms than Facebook, as young users are leaving Facebook for other channels to insure privacy from their parents and other factors. 
Other uses for social media by employers are evident from previous research. 
According to Gauravonomics (2010), corporate consultants can use social media for interactive consulting, based on SWOT analysis and for-solution delivery. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 Employer Policy The use of social media by employees may pose serious implications to a corporation through lack of employee productivity, improper communications, and legal problems as well. 
Because of such problems corporations may find it necessary to develop policies addressing social media usage by employees while at work, as well as when not at work. 
According to Thomas (2010), such policies may be necessary in the corporate workplace because “problems associated with the discovery of electronically stored information may be directly applicable to the discovery of information from social networking sites. 
Thomas goes on to warn corporations that “the legal ramification of the use of social networking sites as a marketing tool, or as a means of internal and external communication, must be addressed for companies to be prepared in the event of litigation” (pg. 
1) Edwards, Peters and Sharman (2001) warn that company policy concerning social media usage must be clear or it may be destructive to corporate culture. 
Welebir and Keiner (2005) also comment that acceptable Internet usage in the workplace may be fitting to include in a statement of employee code of conduct. 
Some such policies merely discuss the correct times of usage of the Internet at work, not specific lengths of time of usage (Grossenbacher-Fabsits 2011). 
Not only can employees waste valuable work time if employers encourage them to use social networking sites but they can also “spill company secrets or harm corporate relationships by denigrating business partners” (Baker 2009, page 23). 
It is easy to understand that businesses are drawn to Web 2.0 because of its relatively low cost to operate, but businesses must also be warned that they may wish to adopt broad policies stating that the company actually owns the communication and computer systems used by employees and that “any information created and stored on such systems is property of the company” (Bennett 2010, pg. 424). 
Bennett also states that companies enact policies such as the one described to protect the company from legal risks such as “leaks of confidential information, or exposure to claims of a hostile work environment” (pg. 
425). 
Unfortunately, employees may blur distinctions between correct social media usage in personal and work times. 
Kaupins and Park (2011) agree that employers should establish social networking policies that are clear and that they should take the extra step and provide them to their employees through various channels, including their company policy handbooks. 
After receiving the policy information, employees should also acknowledge receipt of the policy and that they have, in fact, read the policy. 
This may be accomplished by asking the employee to sign an acknowledgement form. 
A more formal, rigorous activity will keep both employer and employee on the same page as far as what is expected. 
This activity may also alleviate employee opinion that their employer will not monitor their social networking activities. 
In addition, this activity may help employers by not requiring them to block their employees from accessing social networking tools, which may be looked at as potentially “unrealistic and unproductive” (Bennett 2010, pg. 428). 
One ethical question also arises from the practice of employers searching their employees’ social networking sites for private details about their current employees, as well as their potential applicants (Kaupins and Park 2011). 
Although some individuals may find this Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 action as unethical, it is stated by numerous corporations, both for-profit as well as non-profit, to be the case of what is actually occurring. 
Although it may be thought unwise to simply ban the usage of social media by their employees, it may also be considered once one is made aware of the time spent on social media sites by individuals. 
According to the Nielson Company, 22% of all time spent online is on social media sites (Jungjck and Rahman 2011). 
Student Policy In addition to corporations, universities understand the need for the development of student policies regarding social media usage, with misuse carrying the threat of possible expulsion (Kind, Genrich, Sodhi, Chretien 2010; Skiba 2011; Williams 2011). 
Introduction of such policies on the university campus may actually aid the student in becoming aware to such policy and make the transition from campus to corporate expectations more palatable. 
Qualifications When hiring a Social Media Coordinator, Marquette University stated that the individual was hired because of their story telling experience instead of their technological skills, although the university did want the individual to be “savvy and knowledgeable about how to use new media” (Stageman 2009, page 33). 
Whether they be known as a Social Media Coordinator, a Social Media Specialist, or a Social Media Manager, these individuals are often “focused on promoting, maintaining and monitoring brand or company image” (D’Angelo 2010, pg. 3). A perusal of advertisements for Social Media Coordinators found that technical functions for the position were not as common as content production functions. 
In addition, both written and oral communications were significant in the desired applicants’ qualifications (D’Angelo 2010; McWilliam 2000). 
D’Angelo also commented that the ads looked for “strategists, managers, content developers and writers and customer service representatives (pg. 
5). Social Media Tools and Technologies As shown in Figure 1, Kriegler (2010) classified the Social Media into seven major categories and supporting technologies (e.g. 
SOAP, AJAX, and RSS). 
The seven categories are: 1. Social Networks (e.g., Facebook), 2. Blogs and Microblogs (e.g., Twitter), 3. Wikis (e.g., Wikipedia), 4. Video (e.g., YouTube), 5. Pictures (e.g. 
Flickr), 6. Audio (e.g. 
Podcasts), and 7. Collaboration (e.g. 
Google Docs).

42% of the subjects reported that their employers are currently using social media for their businesses. 
Students strongly expressed that all the skills listed in the Technical, Communication, and Personal Qualifications are important to the success of a social media coordinator position. 
We also found that there are significant gender differences on the qualifications for a successful Social Media Coordinator. 
Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, Volume 17, Number 1, 2013 This study was conducted at a business school in Central California. 
We plan to expand our target subjects at multiple locations in the nation to generalize our findings. 
We also plan to survey employers to determine employers’ expectations for successful social media coordinator’s qualifications. 
Then we should be able to conduct a gap analysis between students’ perception and the employers’ expectations.
