1. Introduction Childhood epilepsies beginning in the ﬁrst few years of life are frequently characterized by seizures that are resistant to available treatments, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), ketogenic diet, high doses of steroids, and surgery [1]. 
A high seizure burden in early childhood likely contributes to the severe cognitive, behavioral, and motor delays common in these children [2]. 
When indicated treatments fail to control their child's seizures, some parents turn to alternative treatments. 
One of these alternative treatments is cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
The cannabis plant contains approximately 80 cannabinoids, of which cannabidiol and Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two most abundant [3,4]. 
Cannabidiol and THC exert very different physiological effects. 
Most importantly, cannabidiol is not psychoactive. 
In recent years, medical uses of cannabis have focused on cannabidiol, both because of its nonpsychoactive nature and because it shows promise in treating disease [5]. 
However, in states where medical cannabis is legal, cannabidiol is currently only available in whole plant preparations that contain all the components of the cannabis plant, including THC. 
This poses significant risks when administering cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to children with epilepsy. 
First, cannabis use during development has been correlated with deleterious effects on brain development and cognition, primarily due to THC [6,7]. 
Second, THC can be proconvulsive in epileptic brains [8,23]. 
In contrast to THC, numerous studies conducted over the last 40 years demonstrate the anticonvulsant effects of pure cannabidiol in partial and generalized seizure animal models, including acute and kindling models [9–14]. 
In humans, two small double-blind, placebocontrolled studies examined pure canna bidiol in adults with treatmentresistant epilepsy. 
In 1978, Mechoulam and Carlini randomized nine patients to either 200 mg/day of pure cannabidiol or a placebo [15].During the three-month trial, two of four patients treated with cannabidiol became seizure-free, whereas seizure frequency was unchanged in the ﬁve patients receiving placebo. 
In a second small clinical trial, 15 adult patients suffering from treatment-resistant secondary generalized epilepsy were randomly divided into a group that received placebo and a group that received 400 mg of pure cannabidiol daily for up to 18 weeks [16]. 
Among the eight patients treated with cannabidiol, four had a marked reduction, and three had a partial reduction in seizures. 
One of the seven patients receiving placebo experienced a partial ⁎ Corresponding author.

reduction in seizures. 
The most often reported side effect of pure cannabidiol was drowsiness. 
No patients reported psychoactive effects. 
In contrast, an open-label study found that cannabidiol was ineffective in controlling seiz ures; Am es a nd Cr idland repo rted that seizure frequency was unchanged in 12 institutionalized patients with uncontrolled seizures receiving 200 mg of pure cannabidiol daily [17]. 
With the legalization of medical cannabis in an increasing number of states, some parents of children with uncontrolled seizures have opted to treat their children's seizures with cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
This trend has produced an online presence of parents describing cannabidiol-enriched cannabis use in children with epilepsy. 
We asked parents from a Facebook group to anonymously ﬁll out a survey on their experience of giving cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to their children in order to gain insights into the current use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis as an alternative treatment for childhood epilepsy. 
2. Methods The Stanford University institutional review board judged the study exempt from requiring full review by the board. 
Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at the Stanford Center for Clinical Informatics. 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a secure web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies [18].Thesurvey consisted of 24 questions that measured clinical factors, including diagnosis and seizure types and the parental-reported effect of cannabidiolenriched cannabis on the child's seizure frequency and side effects. 
The survey was presented to a Facebook group composed of approximately 150 parents supporting the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to treat seizures in their children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. 
The survey link was posted and displayed for two weeks, then reposted to the top of the group's page for another two weeks. 
Twenty parents responded to the survey. 
Nineteen responses met the inclusion criteria – diagnosis of treatment-resistant epilepsy and cannabidiolenriched cannabis use – and were included in the analysis. 
One response was excluded because the child's diagnosis did not include epilepsy. 
Because the cannabidiol-enriched cannabis survey results had a large number of patients with Dravet syndrome and reported mostly positive outcomes for both seizure control and side effects, we wanted to assess parents' response to the same survey questions with a wellknown and effective treatment for seizures in Dravet syndrome, stiripentol. 
This would allow us to see if the parents' responses to our seizure-burden questions were similar to the results from a clinical trial of stiripentol. 
In addition, side effects across the two drugs could be compared. 
To this end, we administered the same survey substituting stiripentol in place of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
The stiripentol survey was presented to a different Facebook support group composed of parents of children with Dravet syndrome, having approximately 800 members. 
The stiripentol survey link was also initially posted for two weeks and reposted to the top of the group's page for two additional weeks. 
Twenty-two parents responded to the stiripentol survey, and all responses were included in the analysis. 
Responses from both surveys were descriptively analyzed. 
3. Results The results from the cannabidiol-enriched cannabis survey are summarized in Table 1. The children ranged in age from 2 to 16 years. 
Thirteen children had Dravet syndrome (one of whom had epilepsy in female with mental retardation (EFMR)), four children had Doose syndrome, and one each had Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and idiopathic early-onset epilepsy. 
The children experienced a variety of seizure types including focal, tonic–clonic, myoclonic, atonic, and infantile spasms. 
In all cases, except patient 14 (age 2 years), the children experienced treatment-resistant epilepsy for more than 3 years before trying cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
The 2-year-old patient had experienced intractable seizures for 16 months before trying cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
The children had unsuccessfully tried an average of 12 other AEDs before their parents began cannabidiol-enriched cannabis treatment. 
The dosages of cannabidiol the parents reported to be providing their children ranged from less than 0.5 mg/kg/day to 28.6 mg/kg/day. 
The dosages of THC contained within those samples were reported to range from 0 to 0.8 mg/kg/day. 
To obtain dosage information, parents reported having their preparations tested at commercial medical cannabis testing facilities. 
Seizure frequency before administering cannabidiolenriched cannabis ranged from 2 per week to 250 per day. 
The duration of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis administration ranged from two weeks to over one year. 
Sixteen (84%) of the 19 parents reported a reduction in their child's seizure frequency. 
T wo parents reported that their child became seizure-free after more than 4 months of cannabidiolenriched cannabis use. 
Of the remaining 14 parents reporting a change in seizure frequency, 8 reported a greater than 80% reduction in seizure frequency, three reported a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and three reported a greater than 25% reduction in seizure frequency. 
Three parents reported no change. 
Twelve parents weaned their child from another AED after starting cannabidiol-enriched cannabis treatment (see Table 1). The parent-reported beneﬁcial effects of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis other than reduced seizures included better mood (15/19, 79%), increased alertness (14/19, 74%), better sleep (13/19, 68%), and decreased self-stimulation (6/19, 32%). 
Negative side effects included drowsiness (7/19, 37%) and fatigue (3/19, 16%) (Table 2). The side effects reported while taking other AEDs included rash, vomiting, irritability, dizziness, confusion, and aggressive behavior; none of these were reported with the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
To understand if our questions might produce results similar to clinical trial results, we asked for responses to an identical survey replacing cannabidiol-enriched cannabis with another AED in use for Dravet syndrome. 
We surveyed parents on a Facebook group about stiripentol, which is approved only in Europe (though Americans can obtain it). 
We asked these parents to report how stiripentol affects their child's seizure frequency as well as which side effects were evident on the drug. 
Fifteen of the 22 (68%) parents reported that stiripentol reduced their child's seizure frequency. 
Four parents reported a substantial increase in seizure frequency, while three parents reported no change. 
Common negative side effects reported on stiripentol included appetite decrease (5/22, 23%), weight loss (6/22, 27%), insomnia (4/22, 18%), and increased self-stimulation (3/22, 14%). 
The reports in response to our survey are consistent with the published data on the effects of stiripentol in children with Dravet syndrome [19] and support the idea that our survey questions identify seizure and side effects similar to the clinical trial results. 
4. Discussion 4.1. 
Summary We found that some parents of children with severe treatmentresistant epilepsies are using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to treat their child's epilepsy. 
Parents report a high rate of success in reducing seizure frequency with this treatment. 
Cannabidiol-enriched cannabis appears to be behaviorally well tolerated with some positive side effects not commonly associated with other AEDs. 
There are, of course, multiple limitations of an anonymous parental survey. 
We cannot verify the doses or the children's response to cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
We approached a group of parents who have an ongoing interest in using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis for their children's seizures which likely sel ected for positive outcomes. 
Nonetheless, the overall positive results on seizure cont rol in a group of patients with medically refractory childhood epilepsies suggest that further studies of cannabidiol are warranted.

Parents report reduced seizures The report of reduced seizure burden in the population that we surveyed is surprising. 
The children comprised a population with highly refractory epilepsy with the ma jority having Dra vet syndrome, a severe form of childhood epilepsy that often does not respond to available treatments , including AEDs, ketogenic diet, and vagus nerve stimulation [1]. 
The seizures in children had failed to improve with an average of 12 AEDs prior to the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
The children experienced various seizure types, and the parental reports suggest that cannabidiol-enriched cannabis may have efﬁcacy for diverse seizures. 
The limited size of our survey and the small representation of syndromes other than Dravet do not provide additional guidance on what epilepsy types to move forward with in clinical trials. 
It is important to note, however, that the diagnoses and seizure types reported in this anonymous survey could not be validated by an experienced clinician. 
4.3. 
Parents report favorable side effect proﬁles Quality-of-life surveys show that the adverse effects of AEDs have as much of an impact on the patient's ability to enjoy life as t he seizures themselves [20]. 
O ur survey reports suggest that cannabidiol-enriched cannabis is behaviorally well toler ated and may hav e beneﬁcial effects on cognition and mood. 
Many parents reported that their children experienced better sleep, increased alertness, and better mood while taking cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
These beneﬁcial side effects are rare ly reported with pediatric use of other AEDs [21]. 
Additionally, many negative side effects commonly associated with AEDs, such as irritability, insomnia, and aggressive behavior were notably absent from the parent reports on cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. 
Because of the apparent efﬁcacy of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis, 12 parents reported weaning their child from other AEDs, thereby further increasing the child's quality of life b y removing the negative side effe cts associated with those other AEDs. 
4.4. 
Bias issues We recognize that this survey has multiple biases that prevent us from making strong conclusions about the overall efﬁcacy of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis in pediatric epilepsy. 
The positive reports on seizure control and side effects prompted us to investigate whether the wording of the questions produced a strong positive bias. 
We conducted an additional survey, using the same questions, of parents using stiripentol, a drug that is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in Europe. 
Our results from the stiripentol survey are consistent with published studies on the efﬁcacy and tolerability of stiripentol [19]. 
Because the answers to the stiripentol survey match the publi shed data on stiripento l's e ffects, it is unlikely that the wording of the survey questions was inherently biased. 
Still, there remains the bias of subject selection, in that the parents involved in the Facebook group were proponents o f using cannabidiol-enriche d cannabis for their chil dren.

Use of medical cannabis poses risks The new trend of medical cannabis use in children poses risks because of a lack of standardization and regulation, imprecise dosing, and possible adverse side effects and medication interactions. 
A lack of regulation and standardization in the medical cannabis industry results in products that are of questionable quality and composition. 
Most parents reported using cannabis extracts, purchased either from a dispensary or directly from a medical cannabis grower. 
Cannabis extracts are often inaccurately labeled and can contain highly variable levels of cannabidiol and THC. 
These extracts could also c ontain cont aminants, s uch as fungus a nd pestic ides, which may cause long-term organ damage. 
Further, while published reportsonpurecannabidiolinanimalmodels,aswellasinhumanswith epilepsy, have demonstrated an anticonvulsant effect of cannabidiol, the data on THC' s role i n epile psy are c onﬂicting. 
In some cases, THC has been shown to be proconvulsant [22]. 
Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that the removal of THC from epileptic animals treated with THC can lead to hyperexcitability [8,22]. 
4.6. 
Future directions Because parents are increasingly using artisanal preparations of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis in an attempt to reduce their child's seizure burden, it is critical to obtain more data about the safety and efﬁcacy of cannabidiol. 
These poorly regulated preparations may not represent the potential beneﬁts and risks of pure cannabid iol. 
Formal studies to determine safety, optimal dosing, tolerability, and efﬁcacy of a standardized cannabidiol preparation in different popula tions of children and adults with epilepsy will provide the data necessary to determine whether cannabi diol has a place in epilepsy treatment.
