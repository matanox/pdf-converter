Summary Background Up to 21% of adults will develop tinnitus, which is one of the most distressing and debilitating audiological problems. 
The absence of medical cures and standardised practice can lead to costly and prolonged treatment. 
We aimed to assess eﬀ ectiveness of a stepped-care approach, based on cognitive behaviour therapy, compared with usual care in patients with varying tinnitus severity. 
Methods In this randomised controlled trial, undertaken at the Adelante Department of Audiology and Communication (Hoensbroek, Netherlands), we enrolled previously untreated Dutch speakers (aged >18 years) who had a primary complaint of tinnitus but no health issues precluding participation. 
An independent research assistant randomly allocated patients by use of a computer-generated allocation sequence in a 1:1 ratio, stratiﬁ ed by tinnitus severity and hearing ability, in block sizes of four to receive specialised care of cognitive behaviour therapy with sound-focused tinnitus retraining therapy or usual care. 
Patients and assessors were masked to treatment assignment. 
Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life (assessed by the health utilities index score), tinnitus severity (tinnitus questionnaire score), and tinnitus impairment (tinnitus handicap inventory score), which were assessed before treatment and at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months after randomisation. 
We used multilevel mixed regression analyses to assess outcomes in the intention-to-treat population. 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00733044. 
Findings Between September, 2007 and January, 2011, we enrolled and treated 492 (66%) of 741 screened patients. 
Compared with 247 patients assigned to usual care, 245 patients assigned to specialised care improved in healthrelated quality of life during a period of 12 months (between-group diﬀ erence 0·059, 95% CI 0·025 to 0·094; eﬀ ect size of Cohen’s d =0·24; p=0·0009), and had decreased tinnitus severity (–8·062, –10·829 to –5·295; d=0·43; p<0·0001) and tinnitus impairment (–7·506, –10·661 to –4·352; d=0·45; p<0·0001). 
Treatment seemed eﬀ ective irrespective of initial tinnitus severity, and we noted no adverse events in this trial. Interpretation Specialised treatment of tinnitus based on cognitive behaviour therapy could be suitable for widespread implementation for patients with tinnitus of varying severity.

Introduction 16–21% of adults develop tinnitus at some point in their lifetime, manifesting as the perception of a noxious disabling internal sound without an external source. 
1 Although often not recognised by the general public, tinnitus is one of the most distressing and debilitating audiological disorders and aﬀ ects almost all aspects of daily life. 
2,3 Cognitive impairments and negative emotions associated with tinnitus are especially bother some for patients and their families. 
4,5 Because tinnitus is not objectiﬁ ed easily, and medical eﬀ orts at cure have been unsuccessful, the eﬀ ective management of tinnitus complaints is often a lengthy and troublesome treatment process involving numerous disciplines. 
6 Evidence for a uniformly successful treatment of tinnitus is lacking, and present usual-care practices for tinnitus consist primarily of fragmented interventions, which often result in communication to patients that nothing can be done about the disorder and that they should learn to live with it. 6 The absence of standardised practice presents diﬃ culties in assessment, treatment, and identiﬁ cation of subsets of patients with diﬀ erential clinical demands, and in comparisons of clinical and research outcomes. 
7 Two main treatment approaches for tinnitus exist. First, sound-based therapies, such as tinnitus retraining therapy, which involve masking of tinnitus at the sound per ception level in combination with structured counselling sessions. 
8,9 This approach, which is often based on Jastreboﬀ ’s neurophysiological model, 10 aims to ameliorate tinnitus distress through education and exposure to a neutral external sound. 
Through habitu ation to this neutral sound, which is expected to generalise to the threatening tinnitus sound, patients are expected to have diminished annoyance from tinnitus. 
Supporting evidence for the tinnitus retraining therapy approach is scarce, and most published reports derive from retrospective and uncontrolled trials. 
8,11,12 The second main approach is cognitive behaviour therapy. 
13–15 Such treatment is a compre hensive form of psycho therapy aimed at Lancet 2012; 379: 1951–59 See Comment page 1926 Clinical Psychological Science (R F F Cima MSc, J W S Vlaeyen PhD) and Department of Methodology and Statistics (G J P van Breukelen PhD), Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands; Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (I H Maes MSc, M A Joore PhD) and Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery (L J C Anteunis PhD), University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; Centre of Expertise in Rehabilitation and Audiology (R F F Cima) and Department of Audiology and Communication (R F F Cima, D J W M Scheyen MSc), Adelante, Hoensbroek, Netherlands; Centre for Hearing and Balance Studies, Bristol University, Bristol, UK (A El Refaie PhD); Departments of Otolaryngology and Audiology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK (D M Baguley PhD); and Research Centre Health Psychology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium (J W S Vlaeyen) Correspondence to: Dr Rilana F F Cima, Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht University, Maastricht PO Box 616, 6200 MD, Netherlands r.cima@maastrichtuniversity.nl modiﬁ cation of dysfunctional beliefs and behav iours. 
Typically, cognitive behaviour therapy includes psychoeducation, relaxation, exposure tech niques, and behavioural reacti vation, often in com bination with mindfulness-based training. 
Although treat ment of tinnitus with such therapy can reduce distress and improve quality of life, large scale and well controlled trials are needed. 
5,13,15,16 The premise that the intensity of cognitive behaviour therapy could vary dependent on severity of tinnitus complaints has not been tested to our knowledge. 
We developed a new multidisciplinary protocol for treatment of tinnitus, including a stepped-care cognitive behaviour therapy approach with elements from tinnitus retraining therapy. 
Stepped care allows a framework for organisation of health services on the basis of individual needs of patients, with a gradual increase in the intensity of care at each level. 
17 In this randomised controlled study, we aimed to assess eﬀ ectiveness of this specialised treatment protocol compared with care as usual. 6 Methods Study design and participants We undertook a two group, two step, randomised controlled trial at Adelante Department of Audiology and Communication (Hoensbroek, Netherlands), in adult patients with tinnitus, with follow-up assessments at 3, 8, and 12 months after randomisation (appendix). 
Patients with tinnitus who were referred to our centre were invited to an oﬀ -centre baseline assessment, after which they were randomly allocated to either usual care or specialised care. 
We postulated that specialised care would be more eﬀ ective than usual care in terms of improvement of generic health-related quality of life and reduction of tinnitus severity, impairment, general negative aﬀ ect, catastrophic misinterpretation, and tinnitus-related fear. 
Adult patients referred to our centre with a primary complaint of subjective tinnitus were eligible for inclusion. 
We excluded patients who were unable to read and write in Dutch, had health issues that impaired attendance or prevented participation (eg, terminal illness or physical disability), or had undergone treatment at our centre within 5 years before trial enrolment. 
Patients were assessed by an otolaryngologist to rule out pathological changes that needed immediate medical care. 
We obtained written informed consent before assess ment and trial entry. 
The medical ethical board of the Rehabilitation Foundation Limburg reviewed and approved the study protocol (METC-SRL 11/09/2006). 
Randomisation and masking An independent research assistant, who was based outside of Adelante, Department of Audiology and Communication, randomly allocated patients by use of a computer-generated allo cation sequence to usual care or specialised care in a 1:1 ratio af ter receipt of informed consent and baseline assess ments. 
Randomisation was stratiﬁ ed by tinnitus severity (<47 vs ≥47 points on the tinnitus question naire [TQ]) and hearing impairment (pure tone average of <60 dB vs ≥60 dB hearing level in worst ear). 
Within each of the four strata, patients were randomised in blocks of four patients. 
Patients and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. 
Before trial enrolment, patients were in formed that they would be allocated to one of two diﬀ erent treatments aimed at tinnitus management, with a client-centred, stepped-care approach. 
Patients were also aware that by giving their consent they would not be informed to which treatment they were allocated.

See Online for appendix the intervention procedure detailed information about the treat ment received was unveiled, while the partici pants remained masked to the content of the alternative treatment. 
Procedures Usual care and specialised care were provided with a stepped approach (appendix). 
Step 1 and step 2 in usual care and specialised care were completed by 8 months and followed by a no-contact period of 4 months before the last follow-up assessment at 12 months. 
Treatment in step 2 lasted for up to 12 weeks in both treatment approaches. 
Patients started step 2 within 4–6 weeks after 3 month assessment, depending on group-treatment schedule. 
We used case record forms for every patient to Panel 2: Specialised care treatment protocol Step 1 Audiological diagnostics (105 min) • Audiology assistant • Pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry (stapedial reﬂ exes) • Tinnitus analyses: pitch mask frequency and minimum masking level • Uncomfortable loudness level measurement • Hearing aid check and optimisation (if present) • Tinnitus anamnesis using structured interview • Individual consult by clinical physicist in audiology (trained in tinnitus retraining counselling)* • Audiological anamnesis, assessment of audiometry and explanation • Information about tinnitus and hearing loss • Introduction to the neurophysiological model 10 • Reading materials and treatment rationale are provided • Explanation of treatment protocol in the ﬁ rst step and explanation of stepped-care approach • Prescription hearing aid (when indicated by hearing loss) • Prescription sound generator† (when indicated by patient) Audiological rehabilitation (30 min) • Audiology assistant • Check-up after 8 weeks of hearing aid or masking device use • Hearing aid check or masking device optimisation Tinnitus educational session provided within the cognitive behaviour therapy framework (120 min; maximum ten patients with partners) • Psychology assistant • Tinnitus retraining therapy counselling elements • Extensive explanation of neurophysiological model • Fear avoidance discussion • General information about step 2 care is provided • Group discussion and remaining questions answered Intake psychology (extensive tinnitus speciﬁ c and general psychological diagnostic anamnesis; 60 min) • Clinical psychologist • When indicated by scores on tinnitus questionnaire and tinnitus handicap inventory, and by anamnesis, treatment goals for step 2 are formulated in concordance with patient and planned in multidisciplinary team meeting Audiological follow-up (40 min) • Audiology assistant • Pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry (stapedial reﬂ exes) • Tinnitus analyses: pitch mask frequency and minimum masking level • Uncomfortable loudness level measurement • Hearing aid check and optimisation (if present) • Clinical physicist in audiology (trained in tinnitus retraining counselling) • Individual consult* Multidisciplinary team meeting (10 min per patient) • All professionals involved in specialised care • All tinnitus patients are discussed and, when indicated by scores on tinnitus questionnaire/tinnitus handicap inventory and clinical view of psychologist, multidisciplinary treatment goals for step 2 are integrated in a plan of treatment Step 2 Group treatments (treatment intensity and group size varies according to severity; 120 min per session over 12 weeks) • Clinical psychologist, movement therapist, physical therapist, clinical physicist in audiology, social worker, speech therapist • Group sessions (of 10–12 patients, 6–8 patients, or 3–4 patients, dependent on tinnitus severity level and hearing level): cognitive behaviour therapy, psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure techniques, mindfulness-based elements, stress relief, and attention redirecting techniques by means of movement therapy, and applied relaxation • Themed group counselling sessions (including partners) Individual trajectory if group treatment is contraindicated (60 min per discipline per patient for up to 12 weeks) • Clinical psychologist, movement therapist • Combination of cognitive behaviour therapy, psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure techniques, mindfulness-based elements, stress relief, attention redirecting techniques by means of movement therapy, and applied relaxation applied on individual basis (with optional addition of a combination of professionals involved in group treatments) *Speciﬁ cally, the counselling elements of tinnitus retraining therapy were part of intervention, which aimed to educate patients about tinnitus and the neurophysiological model. 
†Sound-generators were prescribed when speciﬁ cally asked for by the patient and were adjusted to produce a small band noise around the pitch match frequency and slightly above hearing threshold, as measured with the small band noise of the sound generator. 
standardise treatments and for collection of trial data in place of medical charts. 
All case record forms included detailed protocols for every separate professional, including supporting staﬀ , and for multidisciplinary patientrelated activities. 
Usual care was provided on the basis of a standardised protocol modelled on the care typically provided by secondary-care audiological centres across the Netherlands. 
We surveyed all 26 audiological centres operative in the Netherlands by telephone as a qualitative study. 
We averaged the number of professionals involved and counselling hours provided, and two independent assessors categorised discipline type and health-care activities. 
Panel 1 shows the usual care treatment protocol. 
Step 1 of usual care was a standard audiological intervention. 
For patients with mild complaints, treatment ended after the ﬁ rst step but these patients remained in the trial for follow-up. 
When tinnitus was more severe (as measured at baseline and after audiological counselling), patients entered step 2 of treatment. 
Panel 2 shows the specialised care treatment protocol. 
Step 1 of specialised care consisted of multidisciplinary diagnostics and speciﬁ c tinnitus retraining counselling, which were undertaken in a cognitive behaviour framework (including audiological rehabilitation when necessary). 
For patients with mild complaints this basic intervention was expected to be suﬃ cient, and they were measured for follow-up only. 
When tinnitus was more severe (as measured at baseline and after psychological screening), patients entered step 2 of treatment, which consisted of three diﬀ erent 12-week group treatment options with levels of care dependent on tinnitus severity and hearing loss (panel 2). We assessed treatment ﬁ delity in a post-hoc investigation of case record forms, attendance lists, and electronic databases, for a random sample of 40 patients per treatment group (usual care and specialised care), to verify whether both treatments were provided according to treatment protocols (adherence) and not inﬂ uenced overly (contamination) by contrasting elements from the other treatment. 
18 The appendix shows speciﬁ cs of the data collection. 
Outcomes Before randomisation, we assessed hearing impairment with pure tone audiometry and tinnitus severity with the TQ to provide data for strati ﬁ cation. 
19 Pure tone audiometry was done bilaterally at 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz with a mobile audiometer (Interacoustics AS208, Assens, Denmark) with audio metry headphones (Telephonics TDH-39, Peltorcapped, New York, NY, USA) and we calculated the pure-tone average for each frequency. 
The primary outcome measures were health-related quality of life (by the health utilities index [HUI] mark 3), tinnitus severity, and tinnitus impairment, which were assessed at baseline and at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months after randomisation. 
HUI mark 3 is a 17-item questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life or generic health on eight dimensions: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain or complaints. 
Every question has ﬁ ve or six levels, and 972 000 possible health states can be computed. 
Possible utility scores range from –0·36 to 1·00 for the HUI mark 3. 20 This index has shown adequate responsiveness in the tinnitus population. 
21 We assessed tinnitus severity with the TQ, 22 which consists of 52 items rated on a 3-point scale and assesses psychological distress associated with tinnitus. 
Psycho metric properties of the questionnaire have proved excellent in diﬀ erent lan guages. 
23 The tinnitus handicap inventory is a 25-item instrument scored on a 3-label category scale, and assesses tinnitusrelated impairment on three domains: functional, emotional, and catastrophic. 
24–26 Both overall and subscale internal consistency were satisfactory in our population.

Table 1: Demographic and baseline characteristics which contained 14 items and has good reliability and validity. 
27 The tinnitus catastrophising scale is an adapted version of the pain catastrophising scale 28 and assesses catastrophic misinterpretations of the tinnitus sound with 13 items rated on a 5-point scale (0 is not at all, 4 is always). 
The tinnitus catastrophising scale has been tested with patients 29 and internal consistency of the total score in our population was excellent (Cronbach’s α=94). 
The fear of tinnitus questionnaire (FTQ) measures fear related to tinnitus. 
Some of the items on this questionnaire were derived from the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia and the pain anxiety symptoms scale. 
30,31 This questionnaire was pretested with patients 29 and has 17 items rated on a true or false scale. 
Internal consistency of the total score in our population was excellent (Cronbach’s α=82). 
Adverse events were surveyed throughout the trial and at all assessments. 
We gathered demographic data with a 5-item questionnaire to establish sex, age, duration of complaints, educational achievement, and adherence area. 
Statistical analysis We identiﬁ ed only one study 5 about quality of life of tinnitus patients attending a specialised tinnitus centre.

We used the reported mean change over time of 0·065 (SD 0·15) in health utility score in that study as measured with the short form-36, 32 to calculate our sample size. 
Assuming an α level of 0·05 (two-sided), power of 80%, and 15% loss to follow-up, we calculated that we would need 99 patients per treatment group. 
We did a post-calculation during the trial to detect a relevant diﬀ erence within the subgroup of patients receiving treatment step 2. As our second treatment step was much the same as treatment in an earlier study, 13 the eﬀ ect size of d=0·62 on the TQ in that study was used to compute power for our step 2. Assuming an α of 0·05 (twosided) and a power of 80%, we needed 41 patients per group in the second step of care. 
Assuming that 21% of all patients entering step 1 would enter step 2, and accounting for 15% attrition, 232 patients were needed per group in step 1. The increment in inclusion was approved by the medical ethical board (METC-SRL 08/07/2008) and the steering committee of the funding party (ZonMW). 
We followed consolidated standards for reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines 33 and used SPSS version 18.0 for all statistical analyses. 
Treatment ﬁ delity was checked ﬁ rst by assessing protocol adherence; dividing the number of required observed elements (essential and unique, and essential but not unique) by the maximum possible number of these elements. 
18 Furthermore, treatment contamination was assessed by dividing the number of observed not allowed treatment elements by the maximum number of these elements. 
Finally, analysis of variance was used to assess equality of adherence and contamination between usual care and specialised care, by using scores calculated for all rated cases (80 patients; see appendix for details). 
We used an intention-to-treat approach; all patients who were measured at baseline and allocated to treat ment were included irrespective of their participation in subsequent treatment or follow-up measurements. 
We used mixed (multilevel) regression analyses for all available data per outcome, without imputation of missing data, and treat ment, time, and covariates as predictors (appendix). 
To assess whether specialised care and usual care treatment was diﬀ erent (measured with HUI and HADS) for patients who had severe tinnitus and entered step 2 and those who had mild tinnitus and step 1 care only, we tested the interaction between tinnitus severity at baseline and treatment (α=0·01 for the interaction test with respect to these outcome variables).

Results Table 1 shows baseline values of the study population and the ﬁ gure shows the trial proﬁ le, including numbers of patients who dropped out and non-responders, with reasons if known. 
Non-response was deﬁ ned as missed measurements at one or more follow-up assessments; participants leaving the trial permanently and informing investigators were regarded as having dropped out. 
Of 741 participants screened for eligibility, 626 were invited for participation, and 492 completed baseline measurements and were randomised to the ﬁ rst step of treatment (247 allocated to usual care and 245 to specialised care). 
Randomisation and treatment allo cation took place between September, 2007, and December, 2009, and follow-up was completed in January, 2011. 
Numbers of participants who did not respond or dropped out did not diﬀ er between groups at any follow-up (α=0·01, p>0·20), as measured with logistic regression with missing/not-missing as the dependent variable, and group, baseline characteristics (age, sex, education, duration of complaints, tinnitus severity at baseline, and hearing loss) and scores on the HUI, the TQ, and the THI at the previous timepoint as independent variables.

Table 2: Primary and secondary outcomes at baseline and 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months after baseline between age and absence of response or dropout at 3 months (p=0·0162) and at 12 months (p=0·0070) after randomisation. 
All other predictors and time points did not reach signiﬁ cance (p>0·832). 
86 (35%) of 247 patients in the usual care group and 74 (30%) of 245 patients in the specialised care group were lost to follow up by month 12. Reasons for nonresponse seemed unrelated to treatment content. 
In the treatment ﬁ delity check the inter-rater reliability between both independent raters for the identiﬁ cation of treatment (usual care vs specialised care) was excellent (Cohen’s κ=0·96), and good for the identiﬁ cation of step 2 treatment (κ=0·79) and speciﬁ c treatment elements (κ=0·74). 
Correct classiﬁ cations of treatment (usual care vs specialised care) for each of the observed elements occurred 97% of the time, supporting suﬃ cient diﬀ er entiation between treatments. 
About 88% of essential treatment elements (unique and not unique) occurred during the delivery of both treatments (mean 88·4% [SD 9·02] for usual care and mean 87·5% [12·6] for specialised care), indicating satisfactory protocol adherence. 
About 6% of the prohibited treatment elements occurred during treatment delivery (mean 4·6% [SD 2·6] in usual care and mean 8·1% [6·1] in specialised care), suggesting absence of contamination. 
Analysis of variance suggested no signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences between usual care and specialised care in terms of protocol adherence and contamination (p>0·6079). 
We noted signiﬁ cant improvements in favour of specialised care compared with usual care for all primary outcomes during follow-up (tables 2, 3, appendix). 
Health-related quality of life increased with specialised care com pared with usual care at 8 months and 12 months (table 3). Tinnitus severity and impairment related to tinnitus were reduced by specialised care compared with usual care at all three follow-ups (table 3). Compared with usual care, special ised care reduced negative aﬀ ect at 8 months and 12 months, and tinnitus catastrophising and fear related to tinnitus at all three follow-ups (table 3). The diﬀ erence between specialised care and usual care that occurred by 8 months seemed to persist to 12 months, and was larger than that noted at 3 months. 
We tested this simpliﬁ ed treatment eﬀ ect pattern against the general model with the following post-hoc analysis: the terms group×t (3 months) , group×t (8 months) , group×t (12 months) were replaced with one group term (group×t) with time coded as 0,0,1,1 for the HUI and 0,1,2,2 for all other outcomes. 
For all six outcomes, the simpliﬁ ed treatmenteﬀ ect pattern was supported (p>0·05 for the likelihood ratio test with 2 degrees of freedom), suggesting that the outcome diﬀ erence between specialised care and usual care increased from baseline to 8 months and remained stable to 12 months. 
We did not note any signiﬁ cant interaction eﬀ ect of tinnitus severity and treatment on HUI (p=0·26) or HADS (p=0·33) at any timepoints, suggesting that the diﬀ erence noted between treatment groups did not depend on tinnitus severity. 
Adverse events as a result of treatment or measurements did not occur. 
Discussion Stepped-care tinnitus management, combining elements of tinnitus retraining therapy within a cognitive behav iour therapy framework, is more eﬀ ective than is usual care for improvement of health-related quality of life and reduction of tinnitus severity and impairment.

Table 3: Estimated group diﬀ erence for primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months, based on intention-to-treat analysis and tinnitus-related fear than does usual care. 
We showed the eﬀ ectiveness of specialised care compared with usual care not only after the ﬁ rst 3 months of ﬁ rst-step treatment, but also after the more intensive second-step treatment approach ended and 4 months of no treatment. 
Notably, our ﬁ ndings were established even though patients with mild tinnitus complaints, receiving only ﬁ rst-step treatment, were included in all analyses. 
Patients with mild or severe tinnitus seemed to beneﬁ t equally from specialised care compared with usual care. 
These ﬁ ndings support our main hypothesis that a stepped-care approach based on cognitive behaviour therapy with elements from tinnitus retraining therapy is eﬀ ective in tinnitus management, both for mild forms of tinnitus and for more severe tinnitus. 
Panel 3 shows a systematic review of present treatment approaches in management of tinnitus. 
Our combination of two main theoretical models and treatment approaches had not been studied previously. 
6 Two main treatment approaches have dominated the management of patients with tinnitus complaints. 
Tinnitus retraining therapy, with its focus on sound habituation, and cognitive behaviour therapy, with its focus on dysfunctional beliefs about tinnitus and associated safety behaviours, have been widely applied and studied. 
8,11,15,16 However, a combination of the two, although previously proposed, 29,34 has to our knowledge never before been investigated in a randomised controlled trial of this scale. 
Our study has several strengths, including a comparatively large sample size, masking of investigators to treatment assignment, assessment of treatment ﬁ delity to strengthen internal validity, and delivery of treatments according to protocols. 
Other strengths were that no patients dropped out from step 2 of treatment, both generic and tinnitus-speciﬁ c outcome measures showed consistent ﬁ ndings and, moreover, the diﬀ erences between treatment groups over time were likely to be clinically relevant. 
The percentage of patients reporting clinically relevant changes 19,35 after 12 months in healthrelated quality of life and in tinnitus severity was larger in the specialised care group than the usual care group. 
Our study also has some limitations. 
Specialised care had several elements, and which of these elements contributed to the overall eﬀ ectiveness is unknown. 
Future studies might adopt a dismantling approach, leaving out potentially redundant treatment components. 
Second, treatment was done in an outpatient clinic for audiological rehabilitation. 
Thus, whether our results can be generalised to other health-care settings or if generalisability is dependent on their similarity to the present setting is unclear. 
We are presently investigating implementation routes in both primary and secondary care. 
In addition to the analyses reported presently, we are undertaking moderation and mediation analyses to provide additional information about underlying mechanisms of change, contributing to further reﬁ nement, tailoring, and increased eﬀ ectiveness of the treatment. 
We also plan to report separate cost-eﬀ ectiveness data for specialised care compared with usual care. 
Data were also collected with the tinnitus coping and cognitions list (TCCL) as speciﬁ ed in our trial protocol. 
The main reason for including this measure was to test the psychometric properties of this new measure in patients with tinnitus. 
The TCCL has considerable content overlap with the tinnitus catastrophising scale, and thus omission of this measure from the presented eﬀ ect analyses should not aﬀ ect our conclusions. 
We plan to report psychometric analyses separately. 
Our ﬁ ndings provide ﬁ rm evidence for an eﬀ ective new treatment approach in management of tinnitus. 
The results are highly relevant for clinical practice because best practice for tinnitus has not been deﬁ ned, 7 and current treatment strategies are fragmented and costly. 
6 Delay of psychoeducation and eﬀ ective treatment is expected to aggravate tinnitus complaints, thereby increasing psychological strain. 
Our ﬁ ndings could lead to consensus in policy about best practice in treatment of tinnitus, standard choices in referral trajectories, and the implementation of standardised tinnitus assessment and thereby more easily comparable outcomes. 
Contributors The trial project members RFFC (principal investigator and main author), MAJ (project adviser and co-promoter), LJCA (project co-leader), and JWSV (project leader) designed the study and obtained funding. 
RFFC and DJWMS (project member and clinical audiology adviser) did the literature search for the systematic review and carried out the qualitative study for the development of the protocol of usual care. 
RFFC and DJWMS, in close collaboration with the specialised care professionals of Adelante, Department of Audiology and Communication, developed the specialised care protocol. 
Treatment manuals of usual care and specialised care were developed by RFFC and DJWMS, and MAJ and LJCA commented on drafts of the manuals. 
Further trial development and Panel 3: Research in context Systematic review We searched various databases to identify relevant studies and review articles on tinnitus treatment in adults. 
Full details of the search are shown in the appendix. 
We identiﬁ ed 216 reports, and two reviewers (RFFC and DJWMS) independently assessed all studies for inclusion quality in this systematic review. 
We identiﬁ ed eight systematic reviews, nine randomised controlled trials, three follow-up or case-control studies, one non-randomised controlled trial, and one assessment of current practice that were relevant to our report. 
Interpretation The combination of two main theoretical models and treatment approaches that we used (cognitive behaviour therapy and tinnitus retraining therapy) was novel. 
Cognitive behaviour therapy for tinnitus seems the most promising approach in diminishing tinnitus-related distress and decreasing the main complaints of patients. 
The use of sound-generating devices, whether masking devices, wearable players, or hearing aids, even when combined with directive counselling sessions, have not been proven to be eﬀ ective as a single treatment approach. 
Furthermore, as is the case in tinnitus retraining therapy-based approaches, eﬀ ects seem modest at best. An integral treatment strategy might be best, with a standardised approach in diagnostics, treatment, and assessments because serial approaches (in random order) could lead to an unwanted increase of health-care use and costs. 
Moreover, a framework based on cognitive behaviour therapy in tinnitus management is advisable. 
design was carried out by the trial management group RFFC, MAJ, LJCA, JWSV, and IHM (principal investigator economic evaluation). 
Supporting literature searches were done by all members of the trial management group. 
Data collection was done by RFFC and IHM, who monitored data collection and integrity of randomisation. 
The statistical analysis plan was set up by RFFC, JWSV, and GJPB (adviser statistical analyses). 
The statistical analyses were done by RFFC with support from GJPB. 
Data interpretation was done by RFFC and GJPB. 
Trial treatments and the usual care and specialised care treatment teams were coordinated and monitored by RFFC. 
RFFC, JWSV, and GJBP were involved in the writing of the report, and the design of tables, ﬁ gures, appendices, and panels. 
RFFC was responsible for writing and for the decision to submit the ﬁ nal paper for publication. 
All co-authors commented on drafts of the manuscript and approved the ﬁ nal report.
