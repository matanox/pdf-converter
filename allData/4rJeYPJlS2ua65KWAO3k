Key words] Disgust^ Emotion^ Personality^ Gender^ NEO 0[ Introduction In the most general sense the term disgust is de_ned to mean {{a marked aversion aroused by something highly distasteful|| "Webster\ 0881#[ Due to the fact that {distasteful| embodies both an objective and subjective assessment\ disgust as it pertains to this research should be understood as including but not limited to a subjective reaction based on fears of physical or psychological incorporation of the disgust stimulus[ Darwin "0761:0854# was perhaps the _rst to recognize disgust as {{something revolting\ primarily in relation to the sense of taste\ as actually perceived or vividly imagined^ and secondarily to anything that causes a similar feeling\ through the sense of smell\  Corresponding author[ E!mail] mfsÝloyola[edu B[A[ Druschel\ M[F[ Sherman:Personality and Individual Differences 15 "0888# 628Ð637639 touch or even eyesight|| "p[ 142#[ Angyal "0830# furthered the discussion on disgust by postulating that at the core of the human disgust reaction was a threat of oral incorporation[ Most recently the available research on disgust reactions has focused on factors which may be associated with the perception of an object as disgusting "Rozin + Fallon\ 0876#[ These studies "Haidt\ McCauley + Rozin\ 0883^ Rozin + Fallon\ 0876# have focused on the inappropriate nature of the stimulus such as the eating of an object not designated as food "paper\ rocks\ etc[# or the acknowledged inherent danger associated with the incorporation of the object "i[e[ poison mushrooms#[ What has been determined is that there are certain characteristics of disgust stimuli which in turn a}ect the severity of the disgust response in humans[ Perhaps most importantly\ this research has culminated in an understanding that the disgust reaction serves as both psychological and physio! 
logical defense mechanisms[ Research on disgust reactions has only recently taken into consideration the role which the participant|s personality and gender may play in determining the disgust reaction "Quigley\ Sher! 
man + Sherman\ 0886^ Wronska\ 0889#[ There is reason to believe that as a phenomenological experience\ the individual response to a disgust stimulus will vary in relation to gender and personality characteristics[ The research of Rozin and his associates regarding disgust and disgust sensitivity becomes paramount to the conceptualization of a psychological pro_le for a disgust sensitive individual[ Rozin|s years of research on the subject of disgust "Rozin + Fallon\ 0876^ Rozin\ Millman + Nemero}\ 0875^ Rozin + Nemero}\ 0889# has culminated in the 21!item Disgust Scale "Haidt et al[\ 0883#[ By creating the Disgust Scale to measure disgust sensitivity\ Haidt et al[ "0883# provided the means by which researchers could quantify disgust reactions and thus begin a systematic examination of variables related to them[ Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Disgust Scale "Haidt et al[\ 0883# is the ability of the scales| non!incorporative items to elicit a response comparable to those of incorporative items[ Speci_cally the ingestion of spoiled milk held the same item weight as did questions regarding incest or bodily dysfunction:dis_gurement[ Overall\ it appears that factors that are {inherent| within the individual may add a measure of unpredictability in analysing the disgust reaction[ Therefore\ the question becomes what charac! 
teristics of the individual {produce| a particular response to a disgust stimulus< Despite the extent of the past research on the subject of disgust\ it has only been recently entertained that personality and gender play a role in disgust sensitivity[ For example\ Haidt et al["0883# reported a positive correlation between disgust sensitivity and neuroticism\ and a negative correlation between disgust sensitivity and psychoticism as measured by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire "Eysenck + Eysenck\ 0864^ EPQ#[ Haidt et al[ "0883# also found gender to be the most powerful predictor of disgust sensitivity with women scoring as much as one standard deviation higher on disgust sensitivity than did men[ Furthermore\ in the development of their scale to measure attitudes about body products and body elimination\ Templer\ King\ Brooner and Corgiat "0873# found that women showed stronger negative attitudes towards body products and these stronger negative attitudes were correlated positively with high measures of neuroticism and obsessiveness for women[ An implication of these _ndings is that the reaction to a disgust stimulus is much more than the product of an oral incorporative threat "biological threat# and is at the very least the product of socio!cultural conditioning and psychological functioning[ Perceived contamination of an object is the product of both objective and subjective assessments of stimuli[ A subjective assessment of contamination is the product of any number of psychological functions which operate to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the body[ The defense mechanisms which provide for the protection of the biological and psychological integrity of the body can be conceptualized as a derivative of genetic\ religious\ and social entities[ It is the discrepancy between protective measures which are biologically sound and those which are extreme or illogical where the issue of an individual|s psychological state is brought into play[ Therefore\ given a population where overt psychological dysfunction is absent\ it is logical to assume that di}erences in disgust sensitivity may be the result of personality and gender di}erences[ In fact\ more recently\ Quigley et al[ "0886# demonstrated that disgust sensitivity was related to DSM III!R personality types "Schizoid\ Obsessive Compulsive\ and Dependent# among normal functioning college students[ Obviously\ di}erences in disgust sensitivity as a function of gender and personality traits open up a potentially productive area of research[ It was the purpose of this study to determine if there are dimensions of the normal adult personality which may be correlated with responses on the Disgust Scale "Haidt et al[\ 0883#[ Such information would enable a more comprehensive understanding of disgust reactions\ and identify the factors within individuals which may predispose them to a disgust reaction[ In the current study\ psychological factors possibly related to disgust sensitivity were examined speci_cally through the use of the _ve factor model of personality or more commonly known as the Big Five "Digman\ 0889#[ In light of previous research _ndings "Haidt et al[\ 0883#\ we hypothesized that there would be a relationship between gender and disgust sensitivity\ such that women would be more disgust sensitive than would men[ In addition\ we predicted a positive relationship between neuroticism and disgust sensitivity such that individuals who score high on neuroticism would also score high on disgust sensitivity[ We also predicted a negative relationship between openness and disgust sensitivity\ such that individuals who score high on openness to experience would score low on disgust sensitivity[ Although not speci_cally predicted\ the moderating role of gender on the relationship between personality and disgust sensitivity was also investigated[ This was examined in light of the large e}ect sizes reported for the relationship between gender and disgust sensitivity[ Finally\ the location of disgust sensitivity within the factor space of the Big Five was examined[ 1[ Methods 1[0[ Participants The sample for this study consisted of 021 undergraduate students "psychology majors# of which 72 were women[ All participants were recruited from Loyola College in Maryland\ U[S[A[[ The sample was predominantly white and middle to upper!middle class\ with 69) Catholic\ 09) Methodist\ 5) Lutheran\ 1) Jewish\ and 01) other[ Eighty!two percent of the participants indicated that their religious beliefs were

0881#[ Participants completed the Disgust Scale prior to starting the NEO!PI!R[ 1[2[ The disgust scale The Disgust Scale "Haidt et al[\ 0883# is a 21!item self!report questionnaire broken down into two parts[ The _rst part "05 items# is designed to probe actual avoidance behaviors as well as a}ective reactions to potential disgust elicitors without any reference to the word disgust "true:false format#[ For example\ {{It would bother me to see a rat run across my path in a park|| True:False[ Scoring the _rst part of the Disgust Scale consists of adding up the number of {true| answers given "along with the three reverse scored items#[ The second part "05 items# represents actual disgust situations and asks the participant to rate each according to the severity of disgust felt[ Each question in the second part is rated 9 for not disgusting\ 0 for slightly disgusting or\ 1 for very disgusting[ An example item reads] {{You see a man with his intestines exposed after an accident||[ Scoring the second part of the Disgust Scale consists of adding up all the answers and dividing by two[ Total disgust scores are derived by summing the scores of the two parts[ Scores can range from 9Ð21 with higher scores indicating greater disgust sensitivity[ In addition to obtaining total scores\ the Disgust Scale also contains eight subscales "seven domains of disgust elicitors "food\ animals\ body products\ sex\ body envelope violations\ death\ hygiene# and one on magical beliefs "contagion and association#[ In their creation and validation of the Disgust Scale\ Haidt et al[ "0883# reported a range of Cronbach a coe.cients over four samples ranging from 9[79Ð9[76\ with a mean sub!scale total "part!whole corrected# correlation of 9[40 on four combined samples and a value of 9[33 on a con_rmation sample[ Quigley et al[ "0886# reported a Cronbach a of 9[75\ while the current study obtained an a of 9[76[ Validity data for the Disgust Scale is sparse at the present time due to the fact that the scale has only recently been introduced[ Haidt et al[ "0883# reported that an initial principal components analysis of the matrix of inter!correlations of the 21 Disgust Scale items "four samples combined# yielded 09 factors\ with a relatively large _rst factor and nine smaller factors[ Varimax rotation of seven factors produced a meaningful _rst factor which accounted for
