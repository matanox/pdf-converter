As modern organizations face more dynamic conditions, employee responsibilities grow less formalized and increasingly difficult to specify (Ilgen & Hollenbeck, 1991; Sluss, van Dick, & Thompson, 2010). 
The line between in-role and extra-role performance is more often blurred (Van Dyne & Ellis, 2004). 
Acknowledging this shift, the domain of behaviors that constitute effective performance has expanded beyond the traditional views, which were anchored to task proficiency (Griffin, Neal, & Parker, 2007; Welbourne, Johnson, & Erez, 1998). 
In particular, proactive behaviors such as taking charge, voicing issues, and initiating change have attracted attention (Frese & Fay, 2001; Morrison, 2011; Morrison & Phelps, 1999; Raub & Liao, 2012), given the value they often bring to organizations and work groups (Crant, 2000). 
Understanding how to cultivate employees’ proactive contributions— contributions that go beyond task proficiency but not to its detriment—is of both practical and theoretical importance and will become increasingly critical as the nature of work grows more uncertain and dynamic (Grant & Ashford, 2008). 
Leadership remains one of the most consequential contextual influencers of employee performance (Chen & Kanfer, 2006; Stogdill, 1974). 
A wealth of studies offers insight as to what and how leadership behaviors impact core task performance. 
Recent research has also shown that leaders play influential roles in impacting employee proactivity. 
But as proactive behavior requires different contextual factors than does core task performance (Parker, Williams, & Turner, 2006), such as a minimum degree of autonomy (Rank, Carsten, Unger, & Spector, 2007), it is shortsighted to assume that leader behaviors that influence core task performance will have the same effect on proactive performance. 
Empirical studies have demonstrated that leaders can both stifle employee proactivity (Burris, Detert, & Chiaburu, 2008; Grant, Gino, & Hofmann, 2011) and spark employee proactivity (Den Hartog & Belschak, 2010; Detert & Burris, 2007; Tangirala & Ramanujam, in press; Williams, Parker, & Turner, 2010). 
While research suggests leaders influence employee proactive behaviors, little theory building or empirical examination has focused on specific leader behaviors that foster or hinder proactivity (Morrison, 2011).

Contents may not be copied, emailed, posted to a listserv, or otherwise transmitted without the copyright holder’s express To advance both theory and practice, it is crucial to expand knowledge as to what behaviors leaders should enact to cultivate both proficiency and proactivity among employees. 
To do so, we examine how two well-vetted, foundational models of leader behavior— directive and empowering leadership—influence and comparatively affect this broadened performance domain. 
Studies have linked both leadership styles to group performance (e.g., Kahai, Sosik, and Avolio [1997] studied directive leadership, and Srivastava, Bartol, and Locke [2006], empowering leadership). 
Yet the two styles are contrasting in terms of the amount of direction versus autonomy provided by a leader. 
Directive leadership focuses on providing employees with specific guidance or a clear path to achieving desired outcomes (House, 1971, 1996), whereas empowering leadership focuses on granting employees a fair amount of autonomy so they are able to make independent decisions regarding how to achieve desired outcomes (Spreitzer, 1995). 
Recent research that jointly examined these distinct styles demonstrated that they differentially impact task performance in newly formed teams (Lorinkova, Pearsall, & Sims, 2013). 
Therefore, it seems intriguing to examine these two leadership styles simultaneously with regard to a broader performance domain, inclusive of both core task performance and proactivity. 
Our purpose in this study is twofold. 
First, we investigate how directive and empowering leadership behaviors impact customer-rated work unit proficiency and proactivity. 
Drawing on goal setting (Locke & Latham, 1990) and empowerment (Kirkman & Rosen, 1999; Spreitzer, 1995; Thomas & Velthouse, 1990) theories, we propose that both directive and empowering leadership will be equivalent in enhancing core task proficiency, but only empowering leadership will enhance proactivity. 
Second, drawing on Barnard’s consent theory of authority (1938), we examine how work unit members’ satisfaction with their leaders serves as a boundary condition for the effects of leadership on unit proficiency and proactivity. 
In terms of methodology, we rely on a field experiment with organizational leaders. 
Employing a field experiment enables us to balance experimental control with generalizability and builds confidence in the causal nature of relationships between leadership behaviors and employee performance (Grant & Wall, 2009). 
Our study makes several theoretical contributions to the literature on employee performance. 
First, we add to the literature on proactive behaviors, forging a link between seminal leadership styles and employee proactivity. 
In doing so, we highlight how leadership approaches that promote proactivity are distinct from those that promote proficiency. 
Second, we disentangle distinct performance effects of directive and empowering leadership, stressing the benefit of renewed efforts in comparing the differential impacts of alternative leadership styles. 
Findings enable improved prescription for managers as to which behaviors are likely to promote specific employee contributions. 
Third, we unearth an important boundary condition for leadership effectiveness, one that may extend beyond the behavioral approaches examined in this study. 
Evidence underscores the importance of considering followers’ opinions of their leader when examining the relative effectiveness of alternative leadership styles. 
DISTINCT FORMS OF LEADERSHIP AND EXPANDED PERFORMANCE DOMAIN The purpose of this article is to provide a comparison of empowering versus directive leadership in impacting core task proficiency (i.e., the degree to which employees meet formal job requirements) and proactive behaviors (i.e., the extent to which employees take self-directed action to anticipate or initiate changes in their environment [Crant, 2000; Parker et al., 2006]). 
1 Both of these performance criteria are now viewed as important in most organizational environments (Griffin et al., 2007). 
We conceptualize the relationships between the two leadership approaches and the two criteria at the work unit level of analysis. 
In this approach, unitlevel leadership refers to “the overall pattern of leadership behaviors displayed to the entire business unit; it can be viewed as a type of ‘ambient stimuli’ that pervade the work unit and are shared 1 The Griffin et al. (2007) model also includes adaptivity, which refers to coping with and responding to changes. 
Adaptivity is positioned as a middle ground between task proficiency and proactivity, in that it is enacted under a moderate level of uncertainty and represents employees’ passive reactions to a changing environment. 
Therefore, adaptability is distinct from yet similar to both proactivity and proficiency. 
Since the goal of the current study is to contrast the differential effects of different leadership approaches, we chose to exclude adaptivity and to focus on the two contrasting performance criteria. 
2013 1373 Martin, Liao, and Campbell among the unit members (Hackman, 1992)” (Liao & Chuang, 2007: 1007). 
Our unit-level approach is consistent with the call to go beyond the conventional, dyadic level of analysis in leadership research (e.g., Dansereau & Yammarino, 1998; Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1995) and adds to the growing line of research taking a generalized approach to examine effects of leadership on a work unit as a whole (e.g., Bass, Avolio, Jung, & Berson, 2003; Grant et al., 2011; Schaubroeck, Lam, & Cha, 2007; Wang & Howell, 2010). 
Directive Leadership In line with path-goal theory (House, 1971, 1996), we define directive leadership as leader behaviors that provide followers with specific guidance regarding goals, means of achieving goals, and performance standards. 
Directive leaders also actively monitor performance and provide appropriate feedback (e.g., rewards and punishments) contingent on employee performance. 
We view directive leadership as similar to the classic “initiating structure” paradigm advanced by the Ohio State studies (e.g., Stogdill, 1950) with the central distinction being that initiating structure places more emphasis on punitive behaviors than does path-goal theory (Schriesheim & Von Glinow, 1977). 
Relatedly, we distinguish directive leadership from transactional leadership, which focuses on leader provision of contingent rewards and punishments, and, unlike path-goal theory, places less emphasis on providing employees with specific guidance on how to achieve work goals (Bass, 1985). 
Historically, directive leadership has been construed as the “default” style for improving performance on core tasks (Hersey, Blanchard, & Johnson, 1996; Vroom & Jago, 1988). 
As core tasks are relatively stable or predictable, leaders can effectively prescribe, in advance, specific goals and directions for subordinates to follow. 
Per goal setting theory, such actions to specify goals improve performance by effectively directing and increasing effort toward work tasks (Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002). 
At the business unit level, directive leaders assign goals for unit members and provide them with specific instructions regarding what is expected (Pearce & Sims, 2002). 
These specific goals and instructions clearly direct the unit members’ efforts toward completion of core tasks. 
Directive leadership also involves providing regular feedback, which goal setting research indicates improves performance if performance is below expectations (Matsui, Okada, & Inoshita, 1983). 
Therefore, directive leaders are able to better ensure their units’ performance is on track through constantly monitoring it and offering timely direction to poorly performing unit members to correct problems. 
Directive leadership also involves rewarding employees for satisfactorily completing core tasks (House, 1996), which can further enhance a unit’s motivation to perform such tasks in an effective manner (Vroom, 1964). 
Therefore, we expect directive leadership will improve business unit core task proficiency. 
There is little empirical research testing the effect of directive leadership on unit task proficiency. 
Extant research on directive leadership has largely focused on its effects on employee attitudes and performance at the individual level of analysis, examining variables such as an individual’s attitude toward his/her leader (e.g., Chiaburu, Diaz, & Pitts, 2011) and individual effectiveness (e.g., Somech & Wenderow, 2006). 
Research has also linked directive leadership with other unit-level outcomes, such as decreased team cohesiveness (e.g., Somech, 2006; Wendt, Euwema, & van Emmerik, 2009), increased efficiency of decision execution (Kahai, Sosik, & Avolio, 2004), and team effectiveness (Pearce & Sims, 2002). 
However, indirect evidence suggests a link between directive leadership and unit task proficiency. 
For example, in a laboratory experiment, Kahai et al. (1997) found directive leadership increased group members’ solution-oriented suggestions and enhanced group productivity within the context of a structured task (i.e., similar in nature to formalized role expectations and core task proficiency requirements). 
Recently, a lab study by Lorinkova et al. (2013) offered initial evidence that directive leadership increases collective clarity about roles and responsibilities, facilitating performance at earlier stages of teamwork. 
Meta-analyses by Judge, Piccolo, and Ilies (2004) as well as by Burke, Stagl, Klein, Goodwin, Salas, and Halpin (2007) offer further support; both positively linked leadership behaviors of initiating structure—akin to but distinct from directive leadership—to group or team productivity. 
Extending this literature by offering an explicit test of the effects of directive leadership on a work unit’s core task proficiency in a field experiment, we propose: Hypothesis 1. Directive leadership improves work unit core task proficiency. 
1374 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal As directive leaders principally influence performance by clarifying goals and the specific means of accomplishing these goals (House, 1971, 1996), such leader behaviors are likely to undermine employees’ self-directed actions (Locke & Latham, 1990), which are central to engaging in proactive behaviors. 
In keeping with goal setting research, we expect that when unit employees are assigned goals and given relatively specific instructions regarding how to achieve these goals, they will divert attention away from alternative means of accomplishing goals (i.e., proactive behaviors). 
Furthermore, the active monitoring by more directive leaders is likely to discourage employees from deviating from explicitly sanctioned paths toward achieving end goals. 
Even less empirical research has investigated the impact of directive leadership on proactive behaviors. 
However, research related to creativity suggests that more authoritative or controlling forms of leadership tend to negatively impact individual employees’ creativity (e.g., Amabile, Schatzel, Moneta, & Kramer, 2004; Tierney & Farmer, 2002), a type of performance that also requires employees to challenge the status quo and has been positioned as a dimension of proactive behavior (Parker & Collins, 2010). 
Directive leaders have been shown to decrease member confidence in work groups (Peterson, 1997), which may inhibit them from being proactive (Parker, Bindl, & Strauss, 2010). 
Such empirical evidence suggests directive leadership may discourage proactive behavior among individuals within work groups. 
Given the theoretical rationale, we extend this literature to the work unit level of analysis and expect directive leader behaviors will negatively impact proactive behaviors within leaders’ units. 
Hypothesis 2. Directive leadership decreases work unit proactive behaviors. 
Empowering Leadership Following prior work, we define empowering leadership as the process by which leaders share power with employees by providing additional responsibility and decision-making authority over work and resources as well as the support needed to handle the additional responsibility effectively (Ahearne, Mathieu, & Rapp, 2005; Hollander, 2009). 
Empowering leadership is related to the concept of delegation but differs in that delegation generally refers to employee ownership of more specific tasks, whereas empowering leadership implies an ongoing philosophy of sharing broader responsibilities (Mills & Ungson, 2003). 
In addition, delegation tends to focus specifically on the transfer of power, while empowering leadership tends to encompass a broader range of behaviors, such as expressing confidence in employees and assisting in building employee capabilities (Ahearne et al., 2005; Yukl & Lepsinger, 2004). 
Empowering leadership also differs from participative leadership in that the latter involves leaders soliciting employee input or making decisions jointly with employees; and such behaviors are generally viewed as only one aspect of empowering leadership (see Ahearne et al., 2005; Zhang & Bartol, 2010). 
We also distinguish empowering leadership from transformational leadership, with the latter emphasizing leader charisma, vision, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration of followers (Bass, 1985). 
Transformational leadership may o r may not include empowering behaviors, as charismatic or visionary leaders can still operate in an autocratic (i.e., not empowering) manner (Bass, 1997). 
Three theoretical perspectives support a positive relationship between empowering leadership and employee proactivity within their work units. 
First, self-determination theory (SDT; Gagne & Deci, 2005) argues that the need for competence and autonomy is paramount to the formation of intrinsic motivation. 
Such motivation encourages more complex, creative, proactive, and self-directed activities, as these autonomous behaviors are intrinsically satisfying (Gagne & Deci, 2005). 
A further SDT proposal is that managers’ interpersonal style is an ambient social context that facilitates intrinsic motivation. 
Empowering leaders delegate authority to employees, involve employees in decision making, share power with employees, encourage selfmanagement of work, and convey confidence in employees’ ability to handle challenging work (Ahearne et al., 2005). 
We argue that these leadership behaviors can help employees gain a sense of competence and autonomy, hence enhancing intrinsic motivation and subsequently proactive behavior. 
Second, recent theoretical development of proactive work behavior (Parker et al., 2006) proposes role breadth self-efficacy (i.e., self-perceived capability to perform a range of proactive, interpersonal, and integrative activities that extend beyond prescribed tasks) as a key driver of proactive work performance and as stimulated by work environment factors such as autonomy and supportive su2013 1375 Martin, Liao, and Campbell pervision. 
Consequently, empowering leadership, which offers employees autonomy and support for pursuing unstructured tasks, should enhance employees’ role breadth self-efficacy—and subsequent proactivity. 
Both SDT and models of proactive work behavior have been considered in the context of individuallevel proactivity. 
Given the focus of the current study—on the overall proactivity of leaders’ work units—the third theoretical perspective, namely, empowerment theory, is most relevant, because homology (Chen, Bliese, & Mathieu, 2005) of empowerment has been demonstrated across individual and team levels of analysis (Seibert, Wang, & Courtright, 2011). 
According to this unified theoretical perspective, psychological (or team/collective) empowerment, including individual (or collective) sense of impact, competence, meaning, and autonomy (Kirkman & Rosen, 1999; Spreitzer, 1995; Thomas & Velthouse, 1990), enhances intrinsic motivation and releases the potential in employees (or in a unit/team) to take initiative and make positive changes in their work roles (or units). 
Further, empowerment theory identified supportive leadership as antecedent to psychological states of both individual and team empowerment (Seibert et al., 2011). 
Indirect empirical evidence—at both the individual and the team level—supports a positive linkage between empowering leadership and proactivity. 
At the individual level of analysis, empowering leadership has been shown to influence individual creativity (e.g., Zhang & Bartol, 2010) and innovative behavior (e.g., Chen, Sharma, Edinger, Shapiro, & Farh, 2011; Seibert et al., 2011) by enhancing an employee’s sense of psychological empowerment. 
In parallel, at the team level of analysis, a team leader’s efforts to delegate responsibility, solicit— and use—team input in decision making and to encourage self-set goals have been shown to enhance team empowerment, which further increases team proactivity (Kirkman & Rosen, 1999). 
Taking these findings together, we expect that implementing empowering leadership will increase the overall proactive behavior of the leader’s unit. 
We add to the limited literature that links empowering leadership to unit proactivity and provide a direct test of the causal effect by using a field experiment. 
Hypothesis 3. Empowering leadership increases work unit proactive behaviors. 
Turning to core task proficiency, when tasks are rather formalized and predictable, we expect increased collective sense of psychological empowerment under empowering leadership to enhance a unit’s employees’ task effort and persistence, which in turn improves the quality and quantity of core task performance (Bandura & Locke, 2003; Hackman & Oldham, 1976). 
Meta-analytic research indicates that supportive leader behaviors are positively correlated with task performance at both individual and team levels of analysis through psychological and team empowerment, respectively (Seibert et al., 2011). 
In addition, Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, and Rosen (2007) showed that empowering leadership climate is positively associated with team performance partially through team empowerment. 
Therefore, we expect implementing empowering leadership will enhance work unit task proficiency. 
However, we argue that empowering leadership is unlikely to outperform directive leadership on core task performance for two reasons. 
First, selfdetermination theory suggests additional autonomy granted by an empowering leader holds less value in connection with routine tasks (Gagne & Deci, 2005). 
Such tasks, being fairly structured, place limits on the extent to which work units can take advantage of the additional latitude granted by empowering leaders. 
As a result, the increases in intrinsic motivation and performance are likely to be relatively modest with respect to core tasks. 
Second, since role requirements for core tasks are predictable and can be prescribed beforehand (Griffin et al., 2007), leaders may delineate detailed procedures on how to carry out core tasks through directive leadership. 
Directive leaders focus employee attention on a proven, well-established path to performing core tasks, whereas empowering leadership allows employees to spend more time exploring how to perform core tasks. 
Goal setting research has shown that when an effective path to goal attainment remains ambiguous, performance often decreases, as employees are more likely to make mistakes while searching for effective strategies to achieve goals (Latham & Seijts, 1999). 
Mills and Ungson (2003) suggested that empowering leadership invites a loss of control, reducing efficiency in fulfilling formalized task requirements. 
On balance, considering both the advantages (in terms of increased effort and persistence) and disadvantages (in terms of limited increases in intrinsic motivation and less guidance from the leader) of empowering leadership as compared to directive leadership, we do not expect the positive impact of empowering leadership on core task proficiency to 1376 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal be superior to the impact produced by directive leadership. 
Hypothesis 4a. Empowering leadership improves work unit core task proficiency. 
Hypothesis 4b. The positive effect of empowering leadership on work unit core task proficiency is equivalent to that of directive leadership. 
Satisfaction with Leader as Moderator Although leadership style is a strong driver of work unit performance, employees also play active roles in shaping work experiences and relationships that influence their work (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). 
Specifically, followers’ attitudes toward their leader affect their receptivity or willingness to accept leader influence (Hollander, 1992, 2009; Smircich & Morgan, 1982). 
Barnard’s (1938) early work on consent and authority suggested the degree of authority leaders have is contingent on the competencies they demonstrate to subordinates—not merely a product of hierarchical position. 
Employees grant more upward influence to leaders who behave in ways that are in accord with their interests and those of their organization. 
Otherwise stated, leaders have authority only to the extent that subordinates are willing to accept their commands, and this “zone of acceptance” is expanded among employees who respect and like their leaders (Simon, 1947). 
Integrating Barnard’s consent theory of leadership (1938) with research on follower attitudes toward leaders, we argue that the effectiveness of leadership is enhanced when employees are more satisfied with their leaders. 
Employee satisfaction with a leader consists of two underlying components: (1) positive affect toward or liking of the leader, and (2) cognitive assessment of the leader as capable and competent (Spector, 1985). 
In terms of positive affect toward a leader, the notion of “referent power” (French & Raven, 1959) leads us to expect well-liked leaders to carry more influence over followers because followers want to identify with them and be like them. 
Empirical research has demonstrated that when employees like their leaders, they are more inclined to accept or internalize their leaders’ performance-related values (Tjosvold, 1984). 
In terms of cognitive assessment of a leader’s capability, the notion of “expert power” leads us to expect that leaders perceived as more competent garner more influence over followers through the leaders’ possessing knowledge, experience, or judgment critical for task accomplishment (French & Raven, 1959). 
Further, when leaders are perceived as competent, their approaches are more likely to be viewed as instrumental to achieving desired goals and resulting rewards and to increase employee motivation to follow them (House, 1996; Vroom, 1964). 
Research has demonstrated that higher perceptions of leader competence increased subordinate compliance to leader requests in both laboratory (Price & Garland, 1981) and field settings (Sachau, Houlihan, & Gilbertson, 1999). 
In the context of this study, we expect when directive leadership is implemented, employees of work units experiencing higher levels of leader satisfaction will be more receptive to the specific instructions provided by their leaders than work units experiencing lower levels of satisfaction with their leaders. 
More satisfied units will have a broader zone of acceptance (Simon, 1947) and be more likely to accept their leaders’ ideas and influence (Tjosvold, 1984). 
Therefore, we expect a stronger, positive relationship between directive leadership and core task proficiency when units are more satisfied with their leader. 
Likewise, when empowering leadership is implemented, we propose that work units that are more satisfied with their leaders will perform more effectively, in terms of both core tasks and proactive behaviors, than units that are less satisfied with their leaders. 
Under empowering leadership, employees are asked to assume additional responsibility and risk in making their own decisions. 
We argue that work units that are more satisfied with their leaders are more inclined to embrace the additional responsibility and risk and to exert the additional effort required under empowering leadership, because they believe their leaders are competent and engaging in a leadership approach that will ultimately prove to be beneficial. Taking these arguments together, we propose: Hypothesis 5a. Work unit satisfaction with a leader moderates the impact of directive leadership on work unit core task proficiency: Directive leadership has a stronger positive effect on core task proficiency when satisfaction is higher rather than lower. 
Hypothesis 5b. Work unit satisfaction with a leader moderates the impact of empowering leadership on work unit core task proficiency: Empowering leadership has a stronger positive 2013 1377 Martin, Liao, and Campbell effect on core task proficiency when satisfaction is higher rather than lower. 
Hypothesis 5c. Work unit satisfaction with a leader moderates the impact of empowering leadership on work unit proactive behaviors: Empowering leadership has a stronger positive effect on proactive behaviors when satisfaction is higher rather than lower. 
METHOD Leader Sample We conducted our investigation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
Our doing so is valuable as researchers have lamented that very little leadership research has been conducted in the Middle East (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004: 64; Kabasakal & Dastmalchian, 2001). 
We adopted a relatively broad approach for recruiting leader participants in an effort to enhance the generalizability of our study (Highhouse, 2011), tapping three sources: (1) business leaders with previous consulting or recruiting arrangements with a large, public UAE university, (2) business leaders from large UAE organizations, whom we asked to nominate leaders from their organizations, and (3) business leaders to whom students referred us, as perhaps receptive to an invitation to participate in the study. 
We inquired about candidate interest in participating in a leadership study. 
We positioned leadership as an important topic for individual and organizational development and, appealing to national pride, indicated the study would allow the UAE to obtain additional recognition in the area of management research. 
For inclusion, participants were required to work in the UAE and to have at least one formal “direct report.” We secured commitment from 95 leaders and randomly assigned leaders (using a random number table) to one of three experimental conditions: directive leadership (n ϭ 32), empowering leadership (n ϭ 33), and control (n ϭ 30). 
Several leaders withdrew citing time constraints, leaving a final sample of 86 leaders (28 in directive, 30 in empowering, and 28 in control). 
Fifty percent of the leaders were women. 
Average tenure as a leader was 10.5 years, and average role tenure was 3.7 years. 
Seventy leaders (81%) were UAE nationals, and 78 (91%) were from the Middle East. Sixty-seven leaders (78%) had earned college or advanced degrees. 
There were no significant differences between conditions on any of these demographic variables. 
Field Experiment Design We relied on a pretest-posttest experimental design with a control group (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). 
Leaders in the two experimental groups (i.e., directive and empowering leadership) were sent a training guide describing the project. 
The first author and at least one research assistant then conducted a one-to-two-hour training session with each leader. 
Fifty-four meetings were conducted face-to-face, and the remaining four via teleconference. 
The goals of the meetings were to (1) describe desired leader behaviors and potential benefits of engaging in such behaviors, (2) understand each leader’s situation and concerns (e.g., number of employees, performance of employees, current projects), (3) plan specific behavior changes for the first two weeks, (4) assess understanding by probing with a few “what if” questions (e.g., “What if one of your direct reports asks you why you are doing this?”). 
Leaders participated for ten weeks, during which they were to spend 15 minutes each day engaging in the new leader behaviors. 
We adopted this approach to have a specific treatment that could be standardized across the two experimental groups and all leaders in each group. 
Our choice of the goal of 15 minutes per day was based on the practicality and likelihood of impacting performance. 
We conducted a three-week pilot study with approximately 25 other leaders, and this time frame appeared to meet both objectives. 
We asked leaders to maintain a daily log. 
Research assistants contacted each leader biweekly (i.e., five times during the study) via e-mail to collect daily logs and via telephone to have follow-up discussions. 
Occasionally, these meetings were held face-to-face, particularly if a leader had any concerns. 
Biweekly meetings allowed us to continuously motivate and coach the leaders on the desired leadership behaviors. 
Directive leadership group. 
We referred to the directive leadership condition as “active coaching” in all materials and discussions with leaders for two reasons. 
First, it seemed more descriptive of the desired behaviors than “directive leadership” for individuals outside of our discipline. 
Second, we were concerned that leaders might view “empowering leadership” as significantly more positive or progressive than “directive leadership,” as directive leadership can carry negative connotations among leaders (Hersey et al., 1996). 
We felt “active coaching” had positive connotations, more 1378 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal closely paralleling those associated with empowering leadership. 
In keeping with research on directive leadership (House, 1971, 1996), we operationalized active coaching as having two core components: (1) monitoring or reviewing employee performance and (2) coaching employees on observed behaviors (e.g., providing clear directions, correcting ineffective performance). 
We noted that monitoring could be as simple as observing employees, but it could also involve actions such as requesting progress reports, more actively participating in a meeting, or seeking feedback on employee performance. 
In terms of coaching, we asked leaders to recognize effective performance by identifying the specific positive behavior and expressing appreciation. 
For ineffective performance, we suggested identifying the specific behavior, indicating why the behavior was ineffective, and specifying an effective alternative. 
We suggested leaders avoid being overly punitive. 
Empowering leadership group. 
In keeping with the conceptualization of empowering leadership (Ahearne et al., 2005), we emphasized to the leaders that such leadership requires a genuine sharing of power, responsibility, and decision-making authority with employees (Forrester, 2000). 
We clarified that a leader retains ultimate responsibility for the goals of her/his work unit, but empowering leadership offers employees additional latitude in determining how goals are accomplished. 
We explained why empowering leadership tends to be effective (e.g., creates a sense of ownership) and provided specific examples of how to share power with employees. 
We suggested leaders follow four steps. 
First, identify a task or project that they are willing to delegate and that they believe employees would be able and willing to manage, something not too demanding or too trivial. We also suggested that the leaders should feel free to consult with employees on these decisions. 
Second, communicate the overall goals and parameters for the task or project. 
Third, express confidence in employees’ capabilities. 
We indicated it was important for employees to have a sense of self-confidence (Conger, 1989; Conger & Kanungo, 1988). 
We explained that accepting additional responsibility may be challenging for employees and may prompt anxiety about making mistakes. 
Fourth, we asked leaders to commit to building employees’ capabilities and spend time coaching them on the new responsibilities (Thomas & Velthouse, 1990). 
As employees assumed new responsibilities, the leaders were expected to observe both effective and ineffective performance. 
We provided these leaders with the same general coaching guidance we provided to the leaders in the directive group. 
Control group. 
This group was not provided with any guidance regarding leadership practices. 
We asked these leaders to “continue leading your team as you normally would.” Measures To assess the effectiveness of our interventions, we surveyed all direct reports for each leader and up to six internal or external customers of each leader’s unit. 
Leaders provided employee and customer contact information; however, we surveyed all employees and customers directly, assuring them responses would be kept confidential. We obtained a list of customers who had interacted with the leaders’ units for a period of at least three months and so had had sufficient opportunity to observe and evaluate the performance of employees in the unit. 
We administered employee and customer surveys before and after the ten-week intervention. 
Surveys were available in both English and Arabic. 
A professional firm was used to translate the English version into Arabic and to develop a back-translation (cf. Brislin, 1980). 
We also asked two Middle Eastern professors to review all measures (in both English and Arabic) for cross-cultural relevance; upon their review, they felt the meaning of all items would effectively transfer to UAE professionals. 
Respondents were given the option of an electronic or paper survey. 
Of 324 direct reports contacted, we obtained responses from 282 (87%) at time 1 and 272 (84%) at time 2, and matched data for 261 (81%) direct reports, averaging 3.1 matched responses per leader. 
Half of the direct reports were UAE nationals (49%), and the vast majority were from Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Yemen, and Egypt (73%). 
Three direct reports were from Western countries; results from analyses with and without these direct reports were essentially the same, so we retained them in all analyses. 
Forty-six percent of direct reports were women, and 57 percent had university or advanced degrees. 
There were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups on any demographic variable. 
Of the 325 customers, we obtained responses from 288 (87%) at time 1 (t1) and 280 (86%) at time 2 (t2), 2013 1379 Martin, Liao, and Campbell averaging 3.9 matched customer responses per leader/unit. 
2 Employee survey. 
The employee survey contained manipulation checks for the two experimental conditions and a measure of initial satisfaction with supervisor to facilitate our moderator analyses. 
We used a five-point response scale anchored by “strongly disagree” and “strongly agree.” A fiveitem measure assessed the directive leadership intervention, which was adapted from behaviors listed as core to directive leadership (Pearce et al., 2003: 277) and best reflective of key behaviors associated with our directive leadership intervention. 
Sample items include, “My supervisor checks to be sure employees follow proper procedures” and “My supervisor clearly explains the way work should be done.” (t1␣ϭ .89; t2␣ϭ .75). 
We used five items to check the empowering leadership manipulation (Ahearne et al., 2005; Arnold, Arad, Rhoades, & Drasgow, 2000), which included items such as “My supervisor explains the overall goals we are trying to achieve” and “My supervisor gives employees the freedom to work on their own.” These five items reflect both behaviors consistent with the conceptualization of empowering leadership (Ahearne et al., 2005) and those relevant to our empowering leadership intervention (t1␣ϭ .82 and t2␣ϭ .86). 
Finally, satisfaction with leader was measured via a four-item scale from Spector (1985), which includes items such as “My supervisor is quite competent in doing his/her job,” “My supervisor shows too little interest in the feelings of subordinates (reverse-scored),” and “I like my supervisor” (t1␣ϭ .77; t2␣ϭ .74). 
Customer survey. 
The customer survey contained performance measures for core task proficiency and proactivity adopted from Griffin et al. (2007) and answered on the scale 1, “strongly disagree”; 5, “strongly agree.” We inserted the name of each leader’s unit at the top of the survey and asked customers to provide an overall evaluation of the collective performance of employees within that unit. 
The four-item measure of core task proficiency includes items such as “carry out core parts of the job well” and “make sure tasks are completed properly” (t1␣ϭ .87; t2␣ϭ .80). 
The four-item measure of proactivity included items such as “initiate better ways of doing core tasks” and “improve the way the work unit does things” (t1␣ϭ .85; t2␣ ϭ .88). 
RESULTS Manipulation Checks We checked manipulation by condition using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Results yielded significant time by condition interactions for directive leadership (F[2, 83] ϭ 7.05, p ϭ .002,␩ 2 ϭ .15, d ϭ .92) and empowering leader ship (F[2,83] ϭ 22.85, p Ͻ .001,␩ 2 ϭ .36, d ϭ 1.00). 
Because empowering and directive leadership shared variance, we tested our manipulation for each leadership style while controlling for the other to isolate the unique effects of each manipulation. 
Directive behaviors increased significantly for the directive leadership group (t[25] ϭ 6.46, p Ͻ .05) but did not for the control group (t[25] ϭ 1.10, n.s.) or the empowering group (t[27] ϭ 0.93, n.s.). 
Empowering behaviors increased for the leaders in the empowering condition (t[27] ϭ 4.28, p Ͻ .05) but not for those in the directive condition (t[25] ϭ .03, n.s.) and the control condition (t[25] ϭ .13, n.s.). 
We also tested each manipulation without controlling for the other, which yielded a similar pattern of results. 
Taken together, these results indicate leaders altered their behaviors in accordance with our interventions. 
Confirming Factor Structure Prior to testing our hypotheses, we conducted two sets of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) using LISREL (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993) to examine the factor structure of our measures on customer and employee surveys. 
Table 1 summarizes these results. 
With respect to the customer survey, which included measures of core task proficiency and proactivity, results demonstrated the two-factor model fit the data significantly better than the constrained model at time 1 and time 2, supporting our measurement model and reinforcing the appropriateness of bifurcating task proficiency and proactive behaviors as proposed by Griffin et al. (2007). 
With respect to the employee survey, analyses in2 To check for nonresponse bias, we compared early responders to late responders on key variables (Rogelberg & Stanton, 2007). 
An absence of significant differences, except an understandably negative relationship between early responding employees and customer ratings of proactive performance, suggested minimal response bias. 
We also included percentage of employee online response and percentage of customer online response as control variables in our hypothesis testing to account for any potential effects associated with modes of response. 
1380 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal dicated a three-factor model, treating directive leadership, empowering leadership, and satisfaction with leader measures as distinct, fit the data reasonably well, and far better than the constrained one-factor model and all other two-factor models, including those in which directive and empowering leadership were constrained to the same factor. 
Justification for Aggregation Since both employees and customers were nested within leaders/units, we analyzed all key variables (i.e., core task proficiency, proactive behaviors, the two manipulation checks, and satisfaction with leader) at the unit level of analysis. 
To justify aggregation, we calculated within-unit agreement values (r wg(i) ) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) at times 1 and 2. We examined agreement against the uniform null distribution and found values ranging from .85 to .93, indicating strong agreement (LeBreton & Senter, 2008). 
ICC1 values ranged from .33 to .63 (median ϭ .53), and ICC2 ranged from .60 to .87 (median ϭ .78). 
Table 2 displays aggregation statistics, which offer strong support for aggregation. 
Main Effects on Performance Outcomes Next, we examined the effects of the leadership interventions on unit core task proficiency and proactive behaviors. 
Table 3 displays descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliabilities, and correlations among all focal variables. 
Table 4 presents pre- and postintervention means by condition, and Figure 1 summarizes the main effects. 
In advance of examining univariate effects, we used multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to compare the impact of the three experimental groups on the postintervention results for both performance criteria, following the approach of others (e.g., Frayne & Geringer, 2000; Peterson & Luthans, 2006). 
The MANCOVA results indicated a significant effect of condition on postintervention performance when preintervention ratings of performance were controlled for (Wilks␭ϭ .45, F[4, 148] ϭ 18.45, p Ͻ .001). 
These findings suggested it was appropriate to examine univariate effects via ANOVA. 
It should be noted that the preintervention performance of the control group was higher than that of either experimental group despite random assignment. 
To minimize factors that could potentially bias effects, we controlled for the following in TABLE 1 Confirmatory Factor Analyses Model Customer Measures Employee Measures ␹ 2 df SRMR CFI ⌬␹ 2 ␹ 2 df SRMR CFI ⌬␹ 2a ⌬␹ 2b 1a.

We employed repeated-measures ANOVA to account for differences in baseline performance differences and assess changes in performance over time. 
The data met the sphericity assumption (i.e., equality of variances of betweenlevel differences) necessary for within-group analysis of variance. 
Findings indicated a significant condition by time interaction on core task proficiency (F[2, 75) ϭ 13.12, p Ͻ .001,␩ 2 ϭ .26, d ϭ .99) and proactive behaviors (F[2, 75] ϭ 29.60, p Ͻ .001,␩ 2 ϭ .44, d ϭ 1.00). 
Hypothesis 1 proposes directive leadership increases unit core task proficiency more than leadership as practiced in the control group. 
Findings from repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of the time by condition interaction on core task proficiency (F[1,46] ϭ 30.18, p Ͻ .001).

Hypothesis 2 proposes that directive leadership reduces unit proactive behaviors.

Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was not supported. 
Hypothesis 3 predicts that empowering leadership increases unit proactive behaviors more than leadership as practiced in the control group. 
Results from repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of the time by condition interaction on proactive behaviors (F[1, 48] ϭ 46.64, p Ͻ .001). 
Providing clear support for Hypothesis 3, unit proactive behavior increased significantly in the empowering leadership group (increase ϭ 1.02, t[29] ϭ 9.32, p Ͻ .001) but not in the control group (t[27] ϭ 0.87, n.s., mean decrease ϭ 0.06). 
Hypothesis 4a proposes empowering leadership improves unit core task proficiency more than leadership as practiced in the control group, while Hypothesis 4b predicts that this improvement will be equivalent to that observed under directive leadership. 
Supporting Hypothesis 4a, results indicated unit core task proficiency improved in the empowering leadership condition (t[29] ϭ 5.81, p Ͻ .001), mean increase ϭ 0.86) but not in the control condition (reported above). 
Results also offered support for Hypothesis 4b, with a time by condition repeated-measures comparison of directive and empowering leadership indicating no significant difference on core task proficiency between the groups (F[1, 48] ϭ 0.01, n.s.,␩ 2 ϭ .00, d ϭ .05). 
Moderating Effect of Initial Satisfaction with Leader To test Hypotheses 5a, 5b, and 5c, we conducted moderated ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses, following steps recommended by Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003). 
Hypothesis 5a predicts higher satisfaction with a leader strengthens the positive effect of directive leadership on unit core task proficiency. 
Hypotheses 5b and 5c predict higher satisfaction with a leader strengthens the positive effects of empowering leadership on unit task proficiency and proactive behaviors, respectively. 
Prior to analysis, we grand-mean-centered time 1 satisfaction with leader and computed product terms for the centered moderator with each leadership condition. 
We then examined multivariate effects, controlling for time 1 task proficiency or proactive behaviors, recruitment source, employee and customer response method, leader gender, leader tenure, leader ethnicity, and the previously discussed main effects.

1384 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal Hypothesis 5a, as there was no significant interaction between directive leadership and initial satisfaction with leader in predicting task proficiency. 
However, post hoc analyses revealed that satisfaction with leader did positively moderate the effect of directive leadership on unit proactive behaviors (␤ϭ .28, p Ͻ .05). 
Tests of simple slopes indicated that directive leadership predicted proactivity when initial satisfaction with leader was high (r ϭ .70, p Ͻ .01) but not when it was low (r ϭ .16, n.s.). 
To aid in the interpretation of results, we followed procedures recommended by Aiken and West (1991), plotting the significant interactions at one standard deviation above and below their means for initial satisfaction with leader. 
This graph is displayed in Figure 2. The results did not support Hypotheses 5b and 5c and, interestingly, were opposite to our predictions. 
A significant negative interaction between satisfaction with leader and empowering leadership is observed in which empowering leadership has a stronger effect on unit task proficiency (␤ϭ Ϫ.35, p Ͻ .01) and proactive behaviors (␤ϭϪ.19, p Ͻ .05) when initial satisfaction with leader is lower rather than higher. 
Tests of simple slopes revealed empowering leadership increased task proficiency when initial satisfaction with leader was low (r ϭ .70, p Ͻ .01) but not when it was high (r ϭ .28, n.s.). 
For proactive behaviors, simple slopes tests revealed empowering leadership prompts significantly higher proactive performance both when initial satisfaction with leader is low (r ϭ .97, p Ͻ .01) and when it is high (r ϭ .72, p Ͻ .01), but to significantly different magnitudes. 
DISCUSSION Traditional views of employee performance have emphasized core task proficiency. 
However, in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain economy, proactivity has become another important aspect of performance (Griffin et al., 2007). 
Our central objective was to examine how and when different forms of leadership are relevant to core task profiFIGURE 2 Moderating Effect of Initial Satisfaction with Leader 2013 1385 Martin, Liao, and Campbell ciency and proactivity. 
In a field experiment over a ten-week period in the UAE, our main effect results demonstrated that both directive and empowering leadership improved work unit core task proficiency, but only empowering leadership improved work unit proactive behaviors. 
Findings also indicated that directive leadership improved proactive behaviors for units that were highly satisfied with their leaders, whereas empowering leadership was more effective in improving task proficiency and proactivity for units that were less satisfied with their leaders. 
The use of a field experiment allows us to conclude with a fair degree of confidence that our interventions actually caused these improvements in work unit performance (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). 
Theoretical Implications Our results advance the performance and leadership literatures in several ways. 
First, we directly link the literature on proactivity and empowering leadership, responding to calls for the need to identify additional antecedents to proactive behavior beyond autonomy, job complexity, and accountability (Grant & Parker, 2009). 
Findings underscore the critical role leaders can play in encouraging proactivity. 
This perspective balances that of early work on proactive behavior, which attributed it largely to stable individual characteristics (Bateman & Crant, 1993). 
Our study identifies empowering leadership style as a contextual, malleable influencer of proactive performance. 
Empowering leadership catalyzed customer-rated work unit proactivity, while directive leadership did not. 
This finding suggests that leaders cannot simply dictate the need for proactive performance, but rather need to inspire and intrinsically motivate it. As proactive behaviors directly alter an environment (Bateman & Crant, 1993: 104), there is often inherent risk for employees who enact such behaviors. 
Empowering, rather than directive, leaders serve to disambiguate how proactivity will be received. 
Empowering leaders’ emphasis on participation and expression of confidence in staff may reduce the potential costs of being proactive. 
This reduction in risk might be all that is needed to tip the mental cost-benefit equation of employees when they are deciding whether to take charge or challenge the status quo (Morrison & Phelps, 1999). 
Our study also responds to the call to understand the time lags needed to influence proactive behaviors (Clegg & Spencer, 2007; Frese & Fay, 2001; Grant & Parker, 2009: 355). 
Frese and Fay (2001) suggested it may take from one to ten years to match proactive employees with jobs that require significant amounts of personal initiative. 
Our field experiment indicates a concerted, developmental leadership intervention can have a noticeable impact on employee proactivity within a few months. 
This time frame suggests employees need relatively modest amounts of leader and organizational support to fuel self-directed actions. 
Second, our study compared performance effects of two forms of leadership. 
At best, the current literature on empowering leadership has been largely silent regarding this comparison. 
Given the current lack of attention to directive leadership, and the significant body of research highlighting the positive impact of empowering leadership on core tasks (e.g., Chen & Aryee, 2007; Huang, Iun, Liu, & Gong, 2010; Raub & Robert, 2010), one might conclude that empowering leadership is more effective than directive leadership in improving work unit core task proficiency. 
In contrast to pervading assumptions, empowering leadership was not more effective than directive leadership in impacting core task proficiency. 
Drawing from von Bertalanffy’s (1972) foundational work on general systems theory, our results suggest that directive and empowering leadership may be “equifinal” in improving work unit core task proficiency. 
That is, the two leadership styles may achieve the same end, at least with respect to core tasks, but the mechanisms or paths may be quite different. 
Directive leadership is likely to operate on the basis of principles put forth in goal setting theory (Locke & Latham, 1990) and path-goal theory (House, 1996), which highlight the importance of behaviors such as specifying goals for staff, monitoring performance, and providing regular feedback. 
Conversely, empowering leadership is likely to operate via increasing staff’s sense of autonomy and responsibility, which improves unit performance via increased collective psychological empowerment (Seibert et al., 2011). 
Third, our study contributes to the leadership literature by challenging the top-down approach of examining a leader’s effectiveness without considering followers’ attitudes toward the leader. 
Extant research on empowering and directive leadership has often assumed work units with different attitudes toward their leader will react similarly to a given intervention. 
In contrast, our findings highlight the importance of adapting leadership behavior in view of followers’ perceptions of a leader. 
1386 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that work units that were less satisfied with their leaders prior to the implementation of empowering leadership experienced greater improvement in both core task proficiency and proactivity than work units that were more satisfied with their leaders. 
In retrospect, this finding may be informed by several perspectives. 
First, from an affective standpoint, employees who are less satisfied with their leaders are more likely to prefer the autonomy associated with empowering leadership because it affords them additional distance from a relatively aversive stimulus—compared with their more satisfied counterparts. 
Further, the positive affect derived from this additional autonomy is likely to be displayed to others, including customers, in the form of positive attitudes and supportive behaviors (Barsade, 2002; Bateman & Organ, 1983; Clark & Isen, 1982; Motowidlo, 1984) and is likely to impact work unit performance (Cole, Walter, & Bruch, 2008). 
Second, from a cognitive standpoint, work units that are less satisfied with their leaders are less likely to identify with their values (Tjosvold, 1984) or view them as competent (Spector, 1985). 
As a result, unit members are more likely to embrace the idea of making their own decisions. 
This is consistent with findings of Zhou and George (2001) indicating that job dissatisfaction, or discontent with the status quo, leads to increases in employee creativity when coupled with organizational support. 
As empowering leaders explicitly encourage employees to pursue their own ideas, work units most dissatisfied with the status quo are more likely to embrace this opportunity. 
We also found directive leadership enhanced proactive behaviors when employees were highly satisfied with their leader. 
We offer four plausible explanations for this unexpected finding. 
First, social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) implies that when employees are satisfied with their leaders, they may be more likely to appreciate directive leadership as providing helpful guidance, which will increase their desire to reciprocate by taking proactive actions. 
However, when employees are not satisfied with their leaders, they are likely to interpret directive leadership as a hindrance to their autonomy, reciprocating by avoiding acts of proactivity. 
Therefore, satisfaction with a leader may shape how social exchange unfolds, altering how employees interpret and respond to directive leadership. 
Second, cognitive evaluation theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) suggests directive leadership involves both control and information components; thus, if control is not particularly salient (as indicated by a high level of satisfaction with leader), the information component may become dominant and provide a host of benefits. 
Directive leaders are likely to reduce role ambiguity and the stress typically associated with uncertainty (House, 1996), increasing employee confidence and self-efficacy, which encourage proactive behaviors (Parker et al., 2010). 
Third, higher levels of satisfaction with a leader are more likely to be associated with higher trust and psychological safety (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990), which may create environments in which employees are willing to be proactive and challenge the status quo—even in the context of directive leadership. 
3 Fourth, directive leadership, when combined with positive leader-employee relations, may resemble a “paternalistic” or “nurturant-task” leadership style, which often exists in traditional cultures such as India (Sinha, 1984) and Arab countries (Muna, 1980). 
Under this leadership style, employees readily accept leader authority, and leaders are warm and caring toward employees and dedicated to their growth. 
Showing dynamics typically associated with parenting, leadership assumes a more directive form, but all parties expect the employee to grow and obtain additional autonomy over time. 
Future research may examine how the holistic caring associated with paternalistic leadership can help directive leaders create environments in which employees feel comfortable enacting proactive behaviors (see Pellegrini & Scandura, 2008; Pellegrini, Scandura, & Jayaraman, 2010). 
Another contribution of the current study is that our findings offer compelling evidence that empowering leadership can improve performance in a “high-power-distance” culture. 
Cross-cultural research on cultural values suggests that in such a culture, the less powerful members of society tend to accept that power is distributed unequally (Hofstede, 2001), and members in positions of authority generally expect obedience (Javidan, Dorfman, de Luque, & House, 2006) and are reluctant to share power with subordinates (Aycan et al., 2000). 
Since empowering leadership is counter to the typical cultural practice in high-power-distance cultures, Spreitzer (2007) questioned whether it would be effective in them. 
There has been limited research 3 We thank our action editor and an anonymous reviewer for this helpful suggestion. 
2013 1387 Martin, Liao, and Campbell examining empowering leadership in high-powerdistance cultures. 
Some research, including studies set in Brazil (Randolph & Sashkin, 2002), China (Chen & Aryee, 2007; Gamble, 2006; Zhang & Bartol, 2010), and Mexico (Robert, Probst, Martocchio, Drasgow, & Lawler, 2000), suggests that empowering leadership will be effective in these cultures, whereas other research suggests empowering leadership will not be effective in high-power-distance cultures such as India (Robert et al., 2000). 
A limitation of these prior studies is that they are virtually all case- or survey-based research. 
Therefore, it is difficult to draw causal inferences from this body of work. 
Using a field experiment, our study demonstrates the beneficial effects of empowering leadership on work unit task performance and innovative behavior in a high-power-distance culture. 
Our findings suggest that although empowerment is not typically expected by followers, nor is it typically granted by leaders in such a culture (Hofstede, 2001; Javidan et al., 2006), when empowering leadership is actually implemented, employees appear to embrace the opportunity. 
Practical Implications From a practical standpoint, our results are encouraging regarding the ability of leadership interventions to have a positive impact on the performance of work units. 
Our interventions did involve a fairly significant amount of leader coaching (e.g., customizing the initial training to each leader’s situation, using daily logs, biweekly coaching), but we were able to influence performance within a few months. 
The directive and empowering leadership interventions were essentially equivalent in impacting core task performance. 
Directive leadership may have negative connotations among leaders (Hersey et al., 1996), perhaps because it is viewed as traditional or as limiting human choice, but our findings suggest that directive behaviors should remain an important aspect of a leader’s repertoire. 
While leader behaviors such as close monitoring of employees and providing specific goals have a tendency to be undervalued (Latham, Erez, & Locke, 1988: 770), they remain critical to driving the performance of work units. 
In addition, we found it more taxing to implement the empowering leadership intervention. 
For instance, we received more questions and more complicated questions from leaders in the empowering leadership group than from those in the directive group. 
As a result, directive leadership may be more attractive than empowering leadership from a cost-benefit standpoint, especially if tasks can be formalized and standardized. 
Our research indicates that when leaders wish to enhance proactive behaviors, empowering leadership is generally superior to directive leadership. 
Our methodology related to empowering leadership involved a delicate balance between providing work units with autonomy or support. 
On the one hand, we emphasized to leaders that they must delegate meaningful aspects of work to their employees. 
On the other hand, we also emphasized that managers had to encourage their employees and be readily available to support them, at least during the initial phases of the intervention. 
In practice, leaders are likely to need a fair amount of organizational support to help them achieve this balance. 
Illustrating a more complete picture, our moderator analyses suggest that leaders should monitor how their employees perceive them. 
When employees are highly satisfied with their leader, they may engage in proactive behaviors even under a more directive leadership style. 
This further bolsters our arguments above supporting the value of directive leadership. 
Alternatively, a case in which employees appear less satisfied with a leader may offer an appropriate opportunity to implement empowering leadership, particularly if there is a need to improve both core task performance and proactivity, as under such conditions employees are more inclined to embrace the opportunity to work more independently. 
Limitations and Future Research We acknowledge several limitations to this study and suggest related opportunities for future research. 
First, our sampling strategy was broad, as leaders were recruited through a variety of sources, and they represented a variety of industries and occupations. 
This minimized the likelihood our results are a function of a specific industry or occupation; therefore, our sample offers a high degree of generalizability. 
However, extraneous factors could be influencing our results. 
We did, however, control for a variety of leader demographic characteristics as well as recruitment source in our analyses to reduce the potential impact of any idiosyncratic factors. 
Second, we recognize that while leaders were randomly assigned to conditions, followers 1388 OctoberAcademy of Management Journal were not randomly assigned to leaders. 
Given the nature of our field experiment, employees were naturally nested within the leaders’ units. 
This limits our ability to rule out the possibility that preexisting differences between employees or leader-employee relations influenced results. 
However, it is unlikely that such preexisting differences would have been aligned with the experimental conditions in such a way as to account for our findings. 
Third, we conducted the study in the United Arab Emirates, a high-power-distance culture. 
Although our theory and hypotheses are not bounded by cultural characteristics, it would be informative to examine how our results generalize to other cultural contexts (e.g., Kirkman, Chen, Farh, Chen, & Lowe, 2009). 
Relatedly, we relied on measures developed and validated using Western samples. 
Ideally, we would have used measures supported by construct validation research in the Middle East (Tsui, Nifadkar, & Ou, 2007). 
Given the overall paucity of management research in the Middle East, we were unable to locate well-validated measures used previously in this context. 
Nonetheless, we followed recommendations by Schaffer and Riordan (2003) and Tsui et al. (2007) to ensure semantic cultural equivalence of the measures. 
Results from confirmatory factor analyses suggested that these measures demonstrated factor structures and discriminant validity that conformed to the results obtained with Western samples. 
Our results thus provide evidence for the validity of these measures in the Middle Eastern context. 
Fourth, by implementing directive and empowering leadership styles exclusively in different groups, our study design embodies the assumption that leaders adopt either a directive or empowering leadership style. 
In practice, a given leader may exhibit both directive and empowering behaviors, depending upon the situation (Sagie, 1997). 
In addition, it may be possible to modify the directive and empowering styles to impact performance criteria in ways that differ from those found in our study. 
For example, directive leadership may be able to facilitate proactive behaviors by explicitly asking employees to take more initiative, by “selling” employees on the value of proactivity, or by rewarding employees for being proactive. 
Likewise, empowering leadership could become more effective in impacting core job performance by granting employees additional autonomy with respect to the execution of specific but critical core tasks. 
Future research might examine the effectiveness of “blended” or “hybrid” leadership styles in impacting performance criteria. 
Fifth, our study was only ten weeks in duration, so we were unable to address the long-term effects of our interventions. 
Longitudinal designs would also allow examination of how mediating processes unfold over time in a work unit. 
Such processes might include unit members’ collective sense of intrinsic motivation (Gagne & Deci, 2005), rolebreadth self-efficacy (Parker et al., 2006), and empowerment (Kirkman & Rosen, 1999) for empowering leadership, and unit members’ collective sense of role clarity (Lorinkova et al., 2013) and goal commitment (Seijts & Latham, 2000) for directive leadership. 
We call for future field experiments to directly assess these mediators to better understand the mechanisms for how different leadership interventions impact different performance outcomes. 
Lastly, as with most experimental research, there exists the possibility that the differences between the experimental and control groups are a function of “resentful demoralization”—lower motivation in a control group because its members do not receive the treatment provided to experimental groups (Cook & Campbell, 1979). 
However, features of our research design and our results suggest that resentful demoralization was not a threat to internal validity in this study. 
This concept implies that control group members are aware that they have not received the treatment provided to experimental group members. 
This was not the case in this study, as the participants were from different organizations. 
Additionally, resentful demoralization is based on the notion that the performance of a control group goes down, whereas the performance of the treatment groups stays about the same; this was clearly not the case in our study: the performance of our control group stayed about the same, whereas the performance of the treatment groups went up significantly. 
A variation on the demoralization concept is that the differences observed in the performance of control and experimental groups is due to the fact that there are general upward trends in work unit performance over time, but the disappointment of control group members prevents the control group from realizing such performance gains. 
We do not think this is likely to have been the case in this study, particularly given the significant, and differential (proficiency versus proactivity), increases in the performance of the experimental groups over a relatively short period of time. 
Further, the literature on group development presents arguments and evidence indicating 2013 1389 Martin, Liao, and Campbell that one cannot always expect a general upward trajectory of unit performance. 
For example, Tuckman (1965) argued that some teams never stop “storming.” Similarly, Kozlowski, Gully, Nason, and Smith’s (1999) dynamic model of team development suggests that although some teams are likely to improve over time, some teams will never reach a coordinated stage of development. 
Taken together, it is unlikely that resentful demoralization offers a convincing alternative explanation for our findings. 
Nonetheless, we call for constructive replications of our study to cross-validate our findings in future research. 
Conclusion Using a field experiment in the UAE, we compared the impacts of directive and empowering leadership on customer-rated core task proficiency and proactive behaviors. 
Results demonstrated that empowering leadership was effective in improving core task performance and proactive behaviors, but directive leadership was equally effective in improving core performance, and it improved proactive behaviors for work units whose members were more satisfied with their leaders. 
Our hope is that this study will spark continued interest in comparing the differential impacts of different leadership styles on distinct performance outcomes, and an increased use of field experiments, which benefit both the science and the practice of management (Cook & Shadish, 1994; Grant & Wall, 2009).
