1. Introduction A lot has been written about the association between socioeconomic status – income, wealth, education – and wellbeing. 
The results from these studies indicate that a favourable position in society is related to higher levels of wellbeing. 
People with a higher income are more satisﬁed with their lives (e.g., Diener & Oishi, 2000; George, 2010), live longer (e.g., Phelan, Link, Diez-Roux, Kawachi, & Levin, 2004), and have a better health (e.g., Kim, Sargent-Cox, French, Kendig, & Anstey, 2011) than people with a lower income. 
Apart from the positive association between socioeconomic status (SES) and wellbeing on the micro level, the wealth of a country among other country characteristics is also important (Bo¨hnke, 2008; Diener & Oishi, 2000; Heukamp & Arin˜o, 2011; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2010; Zheng, 2012). 
In addition to the net effect of country conditions, the connection between income and life satisfaction is less pronounced in wealthier countries, although there are still differences between the rich and the poor in these countries (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). 
There are also studies dealing with the relationship between life events and satisfaction such as marriage dissolution, becoming unemployed or getting married (Headey & Wearing, 1989; Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2003). 
Apart from life course events a long term inﬂuence of living conditions in early life on successful ageing (Brandt, Deindl, & Hank, 2012), on health (Lawlor et al., 2005), depression (Wickrama, Noh, & Elder, 2009), and mortality (Palloni, Milesi, White, & Turner, 2009) can be found. 
Astonishingly, the impact of early life socioeconomic status on life satisfaction has – to the best of our knowledge – not been studied explicitly yet, and it is an open question if a comparable impact of early adversity can be found. 
Contrary to other measures of wellbeing (e.g., health, depression or successful ageing), life satisfaction is seen as a relatively stable concept that is not dramatically affected by positive or negative life events (e.g., Brickman, Coates, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978; George, 2010), even if the adaptation of life satisfaction is not ‘‘perfect’’ after unfavourable life events (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). 
Looking at the connection between childhood conditions and life satisfaction can therefore inform us about the formation of the individual satisfaction level. 
For that reason, we examine the inﬂuence of early life socio-economic status on life satisfaction in old age. 
Early life living conditions are measured on two levels.

ﬁrst level, individual characteristics like housing, family conditions and socio-economic status are taken into account. 
On the second level societal circumstances in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the decade of birth are used to measure the impact of a countries economic performance on life satisfaction. 
Since unfavourable living conditions in early life might be overcome during the life course, we also estimate the interaction between current and early life conditions. 
2. The inﬂuence of early life living conditions on life satisfaction in old age There are two main models on how early life can inﬂuence later life outcomes: the pathway and the latency model (see e.g., Haas, 2008; Zhang, Gu, & Hayward, 2008). 
The latency model supposes a direct link between early life on later life outcomes, where exposure to unfavourable health conditions has a long lasting impact on health in old age (Hertzman & Power, 2004). 
The pathway model differentiates between direct and indirect inﬂuences and assumes that early adversity impacts wellbeing mainly through indirect pathways. 
For example, a low SES during childhood results in a low SES during adult life that has a direct inﬂuence on wellbeing in old age (e.g., Case, Fertig, & Paxson, 2005). 
The view that disadvantages in early life have a long lasting impact on wellbeing in old age can be combined with the theory of cumulative inequality, that is also called cumulative disadvantage theory (Schafer, Ferraro, & Mustillo, 2011, p. 1056). 
According to cumulative disadvantage theory, ‘‘statuses and events from early points in the life course pave the road to an individual’s future, creating a divergence between individuals that expands over the course of time’’ (Schafer et al., 2011, p. 1056). 
This process of divergence between individuals can be described by two different processes (DiPrete & Eirich, 2006). 
The ﬁrst approach is based on a direct link, where inequality is transmitted directly from earlier exposur e to later life inequality, for example when different portfolios produce different outcomes if the int erest rate depends upon the initial amount put into the account, and thus create greater wealth inequality ove r time (DiPrete & Eirich, 2006, p. 273f.). 
The second approach follows the status attainment model developed by Blau and Duncan (1967) and distinguishes between direct and indirect effects of initial inequality. 
For example ‘‘growing up in a poor versus a rich family’’ or single versus two-parent families provoke an accumulation of inequality ove r time (see DiP rete & Eirich, 2006, p. 273). 
The direct approach of cumulative inequality is similar to the latency model where an initial disadvantage results in health problems decades later without any further exposure to unfavourable circumstances (Hertzman & Power, 2004). 
The model of status reproduction with its emphasis on direct and indirect pathways is closely connected to the pathway model. 
It is thus obvious that there are not necessarily two or three models to explain the connection between early life living conditions and later life outcomes (see also Hertzman & Power, 2004), but they can be subsumed under the framework of cumulative inequality. 
The differences between the direct and the indirect approach lie in the different accentuation of the underlying dynamics. 
The main focus of the indirect approach of cumulative inequality is on the process of the accumulation of advantage and disadvantage and how inequality is generated over the life course. 
The direct approach combines the relationship between exposure to disadvantages in early and in later life without any further negative or positive exposure to disadvantages (DiPrete & Eirich, 2006; Hertzman & Power, 2004; Schafer et al., 2011). 
The indirect inﬂuence of early living conditions on wellbeing in later life formulated in the pathway model can be modelled as follows: While the social status of parents is important for the living circumstances in early life, it also shapes the living circumstance in later life, if the realized status depends on social origin. 
Since life satisfaction is inﬂuenced by socioeconomic status (e.g., Diener & Oishi, 2000), it also depends on the social status in early life. 
Furthermore a process of accumulation of inequality might take place over the whole life course when different interrelated mechanisms support the accumulation of advantages or disadvantages (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009). 
Cumulative inequality is not directly connected to wellbeing and therefore life satisfaction, it is merely an explanation how childhood living conditions can affect living conditions in later life and therefore inﬂuence life satisfaction in old age. 
Since the application of the pathway model to life satisfaction is not as straightforward as concerning other indicators of wellbeing, an indirect approach is necessary. 
Childhood living conditions have an indirect inﬂuence where early life living conditions inﬂuence living conditions later in life and therefore also have an impact on life satisfaction. 
Schafer and colleagues suggest that early disadvantages inﬂuence the ‘‘biographical structuration’’ (Schafer et al., 2011, p. 1081) and have a negative inﬂuence on the perception of life. 
This view is in line with the reasoning that an evaluation of previous and contemporary social positions inﬂuences future action and therefore the possibilities of what can be achieved (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009). 
Unfavourable living conditions in early life might therefore also have a direct negative impact on wellbeing in later life since the evaluation of one’s position is likely to be negative. 
If there is a direct connection between early life and wellbeing and additionally an indirect pathway via living conditions in later life in accordance with cumulative inequality, both should reinforce each other. 
There are a lot of additional factors that have been shown to inﬂuence life satisfaction or subjective wellbeing such as socioeconomic status, health, social integration, social relationships, social support and psychological resources (George, 2010). 
Diener et al. (1999) described the inﬂuence of income, religion, marriage, age, gender, job, and education, among others on life satisfaction. 
It can be assumed that these factors are of different importance in different periods in life. 
While emotional closeness to parents might be important in childhood and adolescence (Schwarz et al., 2012), it is less important in later life when adult children are more independent, although early life inﬂuences might also be important for emotional stability in later life. 
Furthermore, emotional closeness itself – as described above – at least partly depends on earlier living conditions. 
We will therefore concentrate on the interactions of similar aspects in early and late life. 
For example, health in early life and health in later life reinforce one another if an indirect pathway via health to life satisfaction is accurate. 
Thus it is necessary to not only differentiate between different determinants of life satisfaction, it is also necessary to disentangle different mechanisms. 
In the following empirical analyses, we therefore distinguish between direct effects of early life and later life on life satisfaction, and interaction effects between determinants from early life and later life to capture indirect effects of early life on circumstances in later life. 
3. Living conditions in a country and life satisfaction In addition to micro level inﬂuences of living conditions in early life, country characteristics also have an impact on wellbeing. 
It is well known that people in poor countries are less healthy, have a lower life expectancy and are less satisﬁed with their lives (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2007). 
Different living standards or unequal access to welfare services directly affects an individuals’ wellbeing in a country (Ladin, Daniels, & Kawachi, 2010). 
In addition, personal wellbeing is driven by the subjective comparison with others (Diener & Oishi, 2000), and thus relative to the personal surroundings (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2007). 
Being wealthy or having a high education do not enhance wellbeing exclusively as such; the social status of other is also crucial: being rich in a rich country is thus different from being rich in a poor country, and therefore country level factors have to be taken into account (Bo¨hnke, 2008). 
Furthermore, living conditions in a country during childhood may impact the evaluation of one’s own childhood. 
If a population was poor during childhood, a low income of the parents matters less than in a rich country. 
The inﬂuence of a poor housing standard (no access to warm water, etc.) matters less if the neighbours were facing the same problems. 
Country characteristics also shape the possibility to succeed in later life. 
There are countries with a high degree of stratiﬁcation, where social mobility is rare, and other societies where – at least theoretically – everyone has the same access to education and therefore early disadvantages should be ampliﬁed less over the life course. 
In an analysis of early life living conditions it is thus crucial to take country characteristics during the time of childhood into account. 
4. Methods 4.1. 
Data The empirical analyses are based on the second and the third wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 
The second wave of SHARE provides information about living conditions, health, social networks, and the ﬁnancial situation of the older population in 13 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland; for details see Bo ¨ rschSupan & Ju¨rges, 2005; Bo¨rsch-Supan et al., 2008). 
The SHARE sample is representative of the non-institutionalized population aged 50 and over. 
The third wave of SHARE, the so-called SHARELIFE-survey conducted in 2008–2009, adds information about the life histories of the respondents (see Schro¨der, 2011, for methodological details) and therefore opens the possibility to assess the inﬂuence of living conditions in childhood on life satisfaction in old age. 
In addition to data from SHARE, measures on the country level are taken from Maddison (2006) who collected historical information on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country. 
To speciﬁcally link country conditions to the appropriate childhood conditions cohorts are constructed per country by differentiating ﬁve groups in each country resulting in 55 country-cohorts. 
4.2. 
Measures 4.2.1. 
Dependent variable For our study we use life satisfaction as an indicator of wellbeing, as this measure adds to the studies of the link between circumstances in early life and wellbeing in later life. 
To the best of our knowledge there is no study yet that examines the inﬂuence of early life living conditions on life satisfaction. 
Life satisfaction is measured using the standard question: ‘‘On a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means completely dissatisﬁed and 10 means completely satisﬁed, how satisﬁed are you with your life?’’. 
Despite some discussion on how to measure subjective wellbeing (e.g., Schwarz & Strack, 1999), the eleven-point scale of life satisfaction is widely used and has been shown to be a reliable measure of subjective wellbeing (Diener et al., 1999). 
4.2.2. 
Independent variables Childhood living conditions are classiﬁed into ﬁve categories: housing, cultural capital, family conditions, health status, and birth cohort. 
All information on childhood conditions in SHARELIFE was asked for the age of ten. 
Housing conditions are operationalized as number of people per room and partly captures the socioeconomic background of the family. 
This variable was created by the author by dividing the number of people in the household by the number of rooms. 
In the mean there are 1.77 people per room in our analytic sample (see Table 1). Cultural capital is measured by the number of books in the household ranging from ‘‘none or very few (0–10 books)’’ to ‘‘enough to ﬁll two or more bookcases (more than 200)’’. 
Although the variable number of books is merely ordinal in scale additional analyses show that it can be treated as metric variable (see also Brandt et al., 2012). 
Family conditions are operationalized by the question whether respondents lived with both biological parents, which were the case for the majority of our sample; only eight per cent did not live with both parents when they were ten. 
Health status during childhood is measured using self-rated health ranging from poor (1) to excellent (5). 
Birth cohort distinguishes between ﬁve cohorts from 1910 to after 1949 in ten-year intervals. 
Two respondents born before 1910 were excluded. 
The variable captures more than merely the age of a respondent. 
It additionally includes the inﬂuence of different living conditions for certain cohorts. 
A cohort born during World War II, for example, differs from other cohorts in various respects (Kesternich, Siﬂinger, Smith, & Winter, 2012). 
On the country level, the mean of the Gross-DomesticProduct in the decade of birth is taken into account. 
It is measured in 1990 Geary–Khamis Dollars and is thus comparable across time and countries (see Maddison, 2006, for details). 
We excluded Poland, East-Germany and the Czech-Republic since those countries did not exist for the entire observation period (Czech-Republic since 1993, East-Germany 1949–1990, Poland since 1918). 
For Greece information about GDP in the years 1910–1920 is only available for 1913. 
Additional robustness checks excluding Greece and excluding only the decade 1910–1920 for Greece, exhibit the same substantive results, so Greece is kept in the sample. 
Apart from childhood and contemporary living conditions, interaction effects between childhood and contemporary living conditions and controls were included in the model. 
First, we included the socio-economic status measured by education and income. 
Education distinguishes between low (ISCED: 0–2), medium (ISCED: 3–4), and high (ISCED: 5–6) education. 
Income is measured as the log of the PPP-adjusted household equivalent income. 
Partnership was measured by a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a respondent lives together with a partner and 0 if he is living alone, independent of marital status. 
Health status in later life was measured by self-reported health with a scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). 
Additionally gender was used as a control variable. 
The choice of variables controlling for later life circumstances depends on the available variables to capture childhood living conditions. 
All variables for later life living conditions should have an equivalent measure in childhood. 
Therefore education was linked to number of books (cultural capital), income to people per room (living conditions), health in later life to health in childhood, and family conditions (living with both biological parents) to partnership. 
4.3. 
Analytic strategy In order to disentangle the inﬂuence of living conditions in early life on life satisfaction in old age, stepwise multilevel models using the Stata module GLLAMM were applied. 
The data comprises two levels, the respondent level and country-cohorts on the second level. 
Since possible inﬂuences of country characteristics on life satisfaction are captured by country-cohorts, the additional country level is ignored in all analyses. 
The necessity of multilevel models was conﬁrmed by using a Likelihood Ratio Test (using the Stata command xtmixed) that compares the multilevel model to an ordinary linear regression model. 
In the ﬁrst step, a so-called ‘‘empty model’’ was calculated, after that, childhood and contemporary living conditions were included. 
In a next step, interaction effects were introduced to disentangle whether contemporary living conditions strengthen or weaken the inﬂuences of early life factors. 
Finally, a model with all main and interaction effects is presented. 
5. Results Life satisfaction is unequally distributed over Western Europe (Fig. 1). The mean satisfaction is higher in Northern Europe than in Southern Europe. 
As welfare spending is higher in the North, one could assume that in countries with a higher developed welfare state and more ﬁnancial capacities life satisfaction is higher. 
This would be in accordance to previous cross-country research on life satisfaction as discussed above. 
Similarly, the positive connection between life satisfaction and the GDP of a country is obvious in Fig. 2: a higher Table 1 Sample characteristics.

GDP is associated with higher mean life satisfaction. 
This result also holds if the two outliers for life satisfaction (below 6) and for GDP (above 100,000) are excluded from the analyses. 
A second ﬁnding from this scatter plot is that conditions on the country level have a long lasting inﬂuence on life satisfaction. 
If a country is doing economically well during the decade of birth, life satisfaction is higher about 50 years later. 
This hints to a long lasting effect of GDP during the time of childhood on the country level. 
Furthermore, countries that have done well in the past are more likely to do well in the future. 
In fact, there is a positive association between GDP during birth and GDP nowadays (Product moment correlation coefﬁcient: 0.57, p < 0.001, n = 55). 
This can also be seen in the development of the GDP from 1910 to 1960 (Fig. 3). The differences between the countries are quite stable over time. 
Also, the GDP for most countries has increased from 1910 to 1960. 
Switzerland, for example, has risen from around 4000 to over 100,000 Geary–Khamis Dollar. 
However some countries like Spain were quite stable during this time period. 
Table 2 shows if this bivariate association between country characteristics and life satisfaction holds after controlling for further childhood and contemporary characteristics. 
Childhood conditions seem to have an independent inﬂuence on life satisfaction. 
The more people lived in a room at the age of ten, the lower is the life satisfaction in old age. 
If the cultural capital of parents was higher (number of books), life satisfaction today is higher. 
Respondents who lived in an intact family at the age of ten (living with both biological parents) have a higher life satisfaction. 
But the latter loses its signiﬁcance once country and contemporary characteristics are included in the model. 
A better health status also has long lasting inﬂuences on later life satisfaction. 
The birth cohort effects show that respondents who were born late (after 1949) are the ones who have the lowest life satisfaction. 
The model furthermore suggests that there are additional links between cohort and later life living conditions, since the level of signiﬁcance changes once these are added to the model. 
As before in Fig. 2, the country-cohort speciﬁc GDP shows a positive inﬂuence on life satisfaction. 
Being born in a country that had a high GDP has positive long-term inﬂuences until old age. 
Contemporary conditions exhibit well-known results. 
A higher income leads to higher levels of life satisfaction. 
Education is only moderately associated with life satisfaction. 
Partnership status is positively correlated with wellbeing in old age: Respondents living together with a partner also report higher levels of life satisfaction. 
Also, better self-reported health is positively linked to life satisfaction. 
Finally, no signiﬁcant gender differences are found. 
In addition to understanding how childhood conditions are associated with life satisfaction in later life, it is of interest whether contemporary living conditions can substitute unfavourable childhood conditions. 
For that reason, interaction effects between living conditions in childhood and in later life are included in the model. 
An interaction effect is found for income: A higher income reduces the negative inﬂuence of unfavourable housing conditions during the childhood. 
The interactions between GDP and education as well as number of books are negative. 
However, as education itself is non-signiﬁcant this result should not be interpreted. 
Between partnership today and an intact family in childhood as well as between childhood and later life health no signiﬁcant interaction effects are found. 
Better living conditions in the parental home (housing, cultural capital) reduce the inﬂuence of GDP as does the cross-level interaction between education and GDP. 
The model ﬁt (Log Likelihood) indicates that the inclusion of all variables improve the model. 
It also suggests that contemporary living conditions have the highest impact on life satisfaction (reduction of 1182 of Log Likelihood). 
Furthermore, the inclusion of interaction effects improves the overall model ﬁt, although the improvement is not as pronounced as for contemporary living conditions. 
6. Discussion While the connection between health, mortality and successful ageing with living conditions in early life is well examined (Brandt et al., 2012; Lawlor et al., 2005; Palloni et al., 2009; Wickrama et al., 2009), little is known with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 GDP r=0.58** Fig. 2.

+ p < 0.10. * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01. regard to life satisfaction. 
This article ﬁlls this gap by investigating the impact of early life conditions (individual and country characteristics) on life satisfaction in old age. 
It additionally broadens our understanding of the inﬂuence of country characteristics on life satisfaction by considering the impact of country conditions during the decade of birth. 
The results show that living conditions in early life have a long lasting inﬂuence on life satisfaction until old age. 
This is in line with research on health and successful ageing: both indicators of wellbeing are positively correlated with early life living conditions (e.g., Brandt et al., 2012; Lawlor et al., 2005). 
In contrast to these studies, it could not only be shown that there is a correlation between early and late life characteristics, we furthermore ascertained that there is an interaction between childhood conditions and income in later life that is important for life satisfaction. 
This implies that there is also an indirect effect of childhood conditions on wellbeing in old age, where being in a favourable position during the childhood years is also associated with a higher income later on. This can be interpreted as sign for the validity of the pathway model, according to which childhood adversity correlates with the changes to achieve a speciﬁc social position in later life. 
Other childhood conditions, for example health status, are not indirectly correlated with life satisfaction. 
This suggests that the inﬂuence of socio-economic conditions is more important in the long run. 
Childhood conditions on the individual level furthermore interact with societal conditions. 
Favourable conditions in the parental household mitigate the effects of adverse country conditions and the other way around: better societal conditions can also compensate for unfavourable individual living conditions (see also Wilkinson & Pickett, 2007, 2010). 
Apart from these indirect effects on life satisfaction, there is also a direct link between life satisfaction and living conditions in early life with signiﬁcant correlations even after controlling for contemporary SES. 
This emphasizes the importance of considering early life inﬂuences in research on life satisfaction. 
If there is a long lasting impact of early adversity on wellbeing in old age, then life satisfaction might begin to form quite early in the life course. 
The inﬂuence of early life on later life wellbeing might thus be in the ‘‘biographical structuration’’ as suggested by Schafer et al. (2011): conditions in early life inﬂuence how we see our opportunities and the possibility to succeed in future. 
However, conditions in later life, like income or health, have a much greater impact on life satisfaction. 
That means early life circumstances matter, but the current social position and circumstances are more important. 
With regard to the theoretical models on the inﬂuences of early life on later life conditions this indicates that the pathway model is appropriate for explaining life satisfaction in later life. 
Although there are also direct effects from early life to late life, the coefﬁcients become much smaller once contemporary living conditions are controlled for. 
Favourable conditions in early life are thus ‘‘inherited’’ from parents and accumulated over the life course resulting in better living conditions. 
Unfortunately, there is no information about life satisfaction in early- or midlife available, so we can only speculate that life satisfaction forms early in life. 
Further research is needed on how different life events, like unemployment, divorce, etc., affect life satisfaction controlling for living conditions in early life.
