(J Clin Neurophysiol 2013;30: 477–489) S everal deﬁned EEG patterns can be observed i n hypoxic encephalopathies. 
These patterns although nonspeciﬁc for etiology, particularly for the milder cases of encephalopathy, reﬂect increasi ng degrees of cerebral dysfu nction . 
At the most severe end of the spectrum, burst-suppression patterns or generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) on a suppressed background (in the absence of anesthesia) are most often encountered after cardiac arrest. Many studies have reported EEG patterns that reﬂect varying degrees of cerebral insult and hence may be indicators of prognosis; some in concert with clinical ﬁndings and other measureable ﬁndi ngs (Scollo-Lavizzari and Bassetti, 1987). 
So far, no single test has a 100% predictive value for any outcome (Young, 2009; Young et al., 2005), although some tests, such as ﬂat-line EEG, and absent cortical N20 responses do accurately predict with 100% certainty, a most severe outcome with death or survival in a nonconscious state. 
The routine analysis of EEG patterns typically may omit two aspects. 
1. A given patient may exhibit several different EEG patterns within a single record or show transitions or an evolution during the course of follow-up studies. 
2. The EEG changes may exhibit spontaneous long-term transitions or short-time ﬂuctuations, as well as reactivity to exogenous stimuli. 
The EEG changes over time might be clinically important as noted by Rossetti et al. (2009, 2012), who found that a reactive EEG background predicted a favorable prognosis in hypoxic encephalopathy. 
The exact type of EEG reactivity produced, and to which stimulus, bears further study. 
The purpose of this review was to provide a preliminary overview of the EEG transitions, ﬂuctuations, and reactions to exogenous stimuli, illustrated by representative examples. 
EEG Patterns in Post–Cardiac Arrest Syndrome The EEG changes observed after cardiorespiratory arrest ranged from a pattern of mild nonspeciﬁc diffuse slow activity to electrocer ebr al inac tivity. 
S evera l arti cles re view these pat tern s (Howard et al., 2012; Kaplan, 2004, 2006; Kaplan and Ro ssett i, 2011; Sutter e t al., 2013). 
Most of these EEG patterns can also be seen after su bar achn oid he morr hag e (Cl aass en et a l., 2 003) , after intracerebral hematomas (Claassen et al., 2007), in critically ill patients with posttraumatic coma (Foreman et al., 2012), and with a wide variety of other etiologies (Chong and Hirsch, 2005; Kaplan and Ro sset ti, 2011). 
Therefore , the EEG mirrors the depth of coma and the severity of cortical dysfunction, largely independent of etiology. 
Grading scales of EEG severity are summarized by Kaplan (2006). 
F urther grading scales have re cently been published by Crepeau et al. (201 3), H oward et al. (2011), and Young e t al.

In cases of multiple EEG abno rmalities, Crepeau et al. (2013) dete rmined the EEG grade by assigning the worst grade present. 
An increase in diffuse theta and delta activity may be seen with preserved alpha or posterior basic rhythm, frequently accompanied by frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (Acolla et al., 2011; Sutter et al., 2013). 
Very slow waves (1/Hz or slower) indicate a severe cerebral problem, especially if unreactive to stimulation, occurring periodically or rhythmically, and with loss of superimposed faster frequencies (Figs. 
1A and 1B). 
Periodic or r hythmi c dis charge s a re frequently seen in postanoxic coma. 
Generalized periodic discharges (for terminology see Hirsch et al., 2013) are electroencephalographically heterogeneous (Chong and Hirsch, 2005) and can appear as spikes and waves, or polyspikes a nd waves resembling absence status of the generalized epilepsies (Fig. 2A). 
The relationship of these patterns to epileptic se izures or nonc onvulsiv e status epilepticus was critically reviewed and discussed by Bauer and Trinka (2010). 
Triphasic waves are now included in GPDs and termed continuous 2/s GPDs (with triphasic morphology) (Hirsch et al., 2013). 
In hypoxic states, the basic epileptic nature is occasionally indicated by the presence of intermingled spikes (Fig. 3). Lateralized periodic discharges are considered to lie along an ictal– interictal continuum and largely reﬂect focal cerebral pathologie s (Pohlma nn-Ede n et al., 1996) . 
In cases of d iffuse cerebral insults like hypoxia, an additional local etiological factor may be assumed (Figs. 
4A and 4B). 
Bilateral independently occurring periodic complexes (Bi-LPDs) indicate a more severe condition (for review see Bauer and Trinka, 2010). 
Burst suppression (BS) is another periodic pattern, originally described as a response to large doses of anesthetics and sedatives, but now is generally recognized as a typical EEG correlate of cerebral anoxia (Niedermeyer, 2009). 
Activity between the bursts may be that of severe suppression or even an isoelectric recording. 
The burst-suppression intervals may vary (Figs. 
4A and 5) as much as by fractions of a second to tens of seconds, may occur in salvos, or may contain some buildup within the bursts resembling “mini” generalized seizures (Fig. 14). 
Bursts may occur with or without spikes (Figs. 
4A and 5). Grading scales solely based on the frequency of the dominant waves may neglect alpha or theta pattern coma (Kaplan et al., 1999) (Figs. 
7A, 9, and 12). 
Several rhythms in the alpha-frequency must be differentiated, especially from drug-induced alpha coma, beta coma (Carrol and Mastiglia, 1977), or spindle coma as seen with transtentorial herniation (Bauer et al., 1982). 
A reactive type of alpha pattern coma (Synek, 1988) is prognostically less severe than the complete nonreactive form (Berkhoff et al., 2000; Kaplan et al., 1999). 
Generalized periodic discharges can combine with rhythmical alpha or theta frequencies (Fig. 6). Low-voltage output EEG and isoel ectric EEG (Fig. 1C) represent the most severe stages of hypoxic encephalopathy. 
Recording criteria and prognostic implicat ions are t he same as in other terminal conditions . 
Transient Fluctuations in EEG Patterns Within a given 30-minute record, the EEG may exhibit transient but spontaneous ﬂuctuations. 
In contrast to transitions, ﬂuctuations occur in short sequences and the previous pattern m ay recur. 
Fluctuations are deﬁned as modiﬁers in the standardized critical care EEG terminology (Hirsch et al., 2013). 
The differentiation of spontaneous ﬂuctuations from reactions to exogenous stimuli might be difﬁcult or even artiﬁcial considering the presence of internal stimuli or surrounding activities present in a busy intensive care unit. 
Kaplan (2006) stressed a signiﬁcant association between reactivity and spontaneous ﬂuctuations. 
Fluctuations deﬁ ned by Noachtar et al. (1999) typically did not include clearcut seizure patterns. 
Without speciﬁc quantitative analysis, several authors have stressed the frequent occur rence of ﬂuc tuations (Bauer and Trinka, 2010; Thömke et al., 2002). 
To our knowledge, no systematic investigation has been performed, and only scattered r eports FIG. 1. A, Girl, 10 years old.

can be found. 
Inter mittent suppression ( Rae-Grant et al., 1991; Scollo-Lavizzari and Bassetti, 1987) and episodic transients (Sutter et al., 2013) have been reported. 
Hirsch et al. (2013) showed ﬁgures of ﬂuctuating frequencies of lateralized periodic discharges, of evolving lateralized delta rhythms, and of intermittent superimposed low-amplitude quasi-rhythmic sharp activities. 
Without speciﬁc comment, many publications contain EEG examples of ﬂuctuations. 
In our examples, we note the following types of ﬂuctuations: (1) blocking of triphasic-like GPDs combined with accentuation of FIG. 2. A, Man, 63 years old (time constant 1.0, high-frequency filter of 70 Hz).

TRANSITIONS OF EEG PATTERNS Transitions of EEG patterns refer to a long-lasting change of the type of EEG abnormality. 
Evolving seizure activity represents a speciﬁc type of transition and is dealt with in FIG. 3. Man, 85 years old (tim e co nstant 1 .0, high-frequency filter of 35 Hz). 
Hypoxic coma after cardiorespiratory arrest. The EEG shows generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphology, intermingled with small spikes, stretches of suppression with superimposed rhythmic 8 to 11 Hz activity.

a separate paragraph later. 
Fischgold and Mathis (1959) and Prior (1973) already described many of these transitions, trends, and reactivity patterns to stimuli. 
Thömke et al. (2002, 2005) studied EEG sequences after a BS pattern. 
The most frequently encountered cascade was that of BS, alpha– theta coma and electrocerebral inactivity. 
Abend et al. (2009) reported transitions from severe background abnor mality into mo re severe grades and from mild abnormalities into less severe EEG changes. 
Bortone et al. (1994) and Synek and Synek (1988) described transitions from theta coma to alpha coma and vice versa. 
With intoxications or anesthesia (Kubicki et al., 1 970), and with deep hypoth ermic circulatory arrest ( Stecker et a l., 2001), FIG. 5. Man, 76 years old (time constant 0.3, high-frequency filter of 35 Hz).

an evolving sequence from diffuse slow activities into GPDs, progressing further i nto BS and ﬁnally into electrocerebral inactivity, has been reported. 
This cascade indicates a progressive, stepwise dissolution of cerebral functions down to the brain stem and acts as marker of brain injury in irreversible situations. 
Examples of transitions are the evolution of GPDs from alpha or theta pattern coma (Fig. 9), from diffuse slow activities into GPDs of triphasic-like morphology and ﬁnally into low-voltage output EEG (Figs. 
1A– 1C), from generalized rhythmical sharp w aves into beta coma, from BS to alpha pattern coma, and from BS to periodic lateralized discharges (PLDs). 
Reactions to Exogenous Stimuli The EEG reactions are deﬁned as reproducible EEG changes secondary to a stimulus. 
Morphology and pathophysiology might resemble spontaneous ﬂuctuations in EEG patterns.

One day after (7A) (time constant 0.3, high-frequency filter of 35 Hz). 
The EEG shows theta rhythms, with periodic sharp transients, and intermittent blocking of the theta-rhythms between the periodic spike– wave transients. 
Hirsch et al. (2013) gave a deﬁnition of reactivity of the EEG background. 
A reactive background is considered a sign of a comparatively better prognosis (Crepeau et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2011; Rossetti et al., 2 009, 2010). 
However, asid e from changes in the backgr ound activity, there ar e n umerous other types of reactivity. 
As early as 1952, Tükel and Jasper (1952) differentiated two types: the b locking type and the alerting type. 
Sev eral reactions excluding stimu lus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal discharges are pre sented, but the se have not been systematically studied . 
The presenc e of stimulus-induc ed rhythmic, p eriodic or ictal discharges may indicate a poor er outcome (Alvarez et al., 2013). 
Stimulation may induce an attenuation of voltage and a mixture of low-voltage fast activity, together with the appearance of delta waves and muscle artifact because of the patient’s decorticate posturing (Fig. 10). 
There may be a change from alpha–thetacomatoGPDs(Fig.11),theblocking of theta coma combined with eyelid artifact (tonic eye movementsdsee below) (Fig. 12), the blocking of GPDs of triphasic m orphology, and the appearance of alpha– theta frequencies (Fig. 13), and ﬁnally a change in the repetition rate of GPDs. 
Clinical and/or EEG Seizures Many reports deal with clinical and/or electrical seizure activity in hy poxic and other comatose states. 
Th e re lations hip o f the depth of coma to prognosis and the value of antiepileptic FIG. 8. Woman, 58 years old.

FIG. 10. Woman, 18 years old (time constant 0.1 (!), high-frequency filter of 70 Hz). 
The patient is unresponsive but awake after cerebral hypoxia. 
The EEG shows superimposed rhythmical frequencies in the alpha range, blocked by painful stimuli (“Zwicken re A..falte”) and replaced by d-waves and muscle artifact from patient posturing. 
FIG. 11. Woman, 70 years old (time constant 0.3, high-frequency filter of 30 Hz). 
The patient is comatose and on a respirator after cardiorespiratory arrest. The EEG shows mixed slow frequencies, with superimposed 6 to 7 Hz activity. 
After acoustic stimulation (“KL”), there are GPDs with triphasic morphology and blocking of theta activity. 
treatment remain debatable. 
The occurrence of seizures implies severe but incomplete destruction of cortical structures. 
Ictal movements may be generalized or focal, inconspicuous, and limited to circumscribed parts of the body (e.g., the hand, the face). 
Accompanying EEG correlates may not always be present, and hence leave the question unresolved as to whether they represent true epileptic activity or release phenomena. 
Clinical and/or elec trica l seizure s are rob ust predi ctor s of poor out come FIG. 12. Man, 65 years old (time constant 0.3, high-frequency filter of 70 Hz). 
The EEG shows diffuse slowing with intermittent rhythmic theta activity over the anterior head regions. 
After acoustic stimulation (“Klatschen”), there is blocking of rhythmical activities and eye-lid artifact. 
FIG. 13. Woman, 74 years old (time constant 0.3, high-frequency filter of 35 Hz). 
Comatose after cardiorespiratory arrest. The EEG shows continuous 2 Hz GPDs with triphasic morphology. 
With exogenous stimulation (“Zuruf”), there is blocking of the GPDs with mixed fast activity over the anterior regions. 
(Foreman et al., 2012; Mani et al., 2 012; Rittenberger et al., 2012; Rossetti et al., 2007, 2009, 2012; Sutter e t al., 2013). 
Bauer and Trinka (2010) differentiated nonconvulsive status epilepticus proper in epilepsies from comatose non convulsive status epilepticus as representing acute symptomatic events. 
These include coma with continuous lateralized or generalized discharges, although there may be a continuum between BS and continuous discharges; a waxing and waning within a continuous run of discharges; or even modiﬁcation of the morphology of the continuous discharges with min imal therapeutic hypothermia and anesthesia (Figs. 
14–16) . 
Nonethele ss, the determination of frank seizure activity remains subjective (Kaplan, 2006). 
Clinical epileptic phenomena fre quently consist of myoclonic jerks (Cele sia et al., 1988; Krumholz et al., 1988; Madison and Niedermey er, 1970; W ijdicks et a l., 1994; Young et al., 1990). 
Myoclonus in coma can be classiﬁed as (1) myoclonic status, (2) myoclonia- like diffuse shivering, (3) myoclonus with or without an EEG correlate, and (4) as focal myoclonus (Hirsch et al., 2008; Koutroumanidis et al., 2008). 
Myo clonic jerks in coma have to be diffe rentiated from chronic posthypoxic myoclonus in patients regaining consciousness typically after hypoxic states occurrin g with acute a sthma attacks (Lan ce– Adams syndrome) (Lance and Adams, 1963; Werhan et al., 1997). 
Hirsch et al. (2004) coined the term stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges. 
Selective stimulus-sensiti ve seizures are described (Fernández-Torre et al., 2010; Niedermeyer et al., 1977; Van Cott et al., 1996; Zivkovic and Bren ner, 2003). 
Postanoxic myoclonus is con sidered by man y to be an agonal clinical sign. 
However, the progno sis is not universally hopeless (Datta et al., 2009). 
Other Involuntary Mo tor Phenomena in Coma Other involuntary motor phenomena in coma states are decorticate and dec erebrate posturing (Fig. 10) an d abnormal tonic eyelid movements (Unterberger et al., 2009). 
Eye lid opening (Fig. 12) is an especially dramatic symptom because it could be suggestive of wakefulness . 
Tonic eye movements are also frequently correlated with BS patterns (Reeves et al., 1997). 
CONCLUSIONS Prognostic statements in postanoxic coma are based largely on clinical, EEG, and evoked potential ﬁndings. 
EEG patterns may ﬂuctuate, evolve, and may demonstrate reactivity to stimuli. 
These are aspects that have not been extensively studied. 
The American Academy of Neurology practice parameters (Wijdicks et al., 2006) considered the predictive value of EEG for poor outcome (before the widespread use of minimal therapeutic hypothermia) to be of insufﬁcient prognostic accuracy. 
A few studies have been published since the advent of minimal therapeutic hypothermia (Fugate et al., 2010; Rossetti et al., 2007, 2009, 2012). 
More work clearly needs to be done on the value of EEG during or after minimal therapeutic hypothermia after cardiorespiratory arrest. The FIG. 14. The EEG in an elderly man who after anoxi a showed prolonge d bursts and b rief suppressions (burst-suppression pattern), but with buildup within the bursts “mini seizures.” The patient died. 
(From Koenig and Kaplan 2013). 
FIG. 15. A 50-year-old man after cardiorespiratory arrest undergoing mild therapeutic hypothermia (A) shows generalized, rapid synchronous bilateral discharges while (B) reflects the EEG change after midazolam with epileptiform complex suppression. 
There are residual unreactive alpha frequencies. 
C, After stopping, anesthesia shows a return to generalized, polymorphic epileptiform discharges albeit at a slightly lower discharge frequency. 
The patient died. 
prognostic reliability of EEG might be increased with a better understanding and analysis of EEG pattern transitions, and reactivity. 
Using broadly accepted terminology, the temporal dynamics of EEG patterns should be evaluated in a systematic fashion with repeated EEGs or continuous EEG monitoring if we are to better unde rstand the prognostic signiﬁcance or therapeutic implications of these patterns and their evolution.
