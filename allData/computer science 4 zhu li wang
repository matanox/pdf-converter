Its fruiting body can be used as the medicine[1]. 
Due to the constraints of biological characteristics and external environment, the fruiting bodies of the wild Phellinus Linteus are scarce and they are not easily cultivated. 
The study has indicated that the Phellinus Linteus polysaccharide is the main medicinal components of Phellinus igniarius Quel, which has the good anti-tumor effect[2]. 
And the effect of the mycelium polysaccharide after fermentation is the same as the one of fruiting body polysaccharide[3]. 
As the fermentation cycle is short and the fermentation is not constrained by seasons and environment, the development cost of Phellinus Linteus can be greatly reduced. 
Therefore, the development of Phellinus Linteus mainly refers to the fermentation development[4, 5]. The fermentation yield of mycelium is closely related to the fermentation conditions. 
In this paper, the fine strains after mutagenesis have been selected as the test materials. 
And the orthogonal rotation combination design has been adopted to build the model for fermentation process. 
The model analysis is helpful to optimize the fermentation conditions, which can lay the foundation for the actual production. 
2. Experimental methods and results 2.1 Cultivation of fermentation seeds 200mL seed medium is installed in 500mL flask. 
The slope strains are put into it and they should be statically cultivated in 28ć incubator. 
The flask should be shaken in the morning and evening. 
When the medium is evenly covered by the white flocculent mycelium, the cultivation is finished. 
It should be put into the refrigerator at 4ć. The seed medium is consisted of 35g glucose, 10g peptone, 5g yeast extract, 1g potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5g magnesium sulfate and 1000mL water. 
1000mL water in experimental fermentation medium contains 51.6g wheat flour, 13.8g rice bran, 0.94g potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.54g magnesium. 
The fermentation lasts for seven days. 
It is required to filter the mycelium after the fermentation. 
They should be dried and weighted after being cleaned by tap water. 
The average values are considered as the experimental results. 
2.2 Optimization of fermentation conditions (1) Design of experiment[6] Based on the single-factor test, it is required to adopt the four-factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination testing program to optimize the experimental factors. 
The specific test factor levels can be shown in Table 1. Tab.

It is an empirical model that describes the relationship between the response variable and the independent variable.

R-square 84.03% RMSE 1.928982 CV 11.34473 The results of F test and lack of fit test have shown that the lack of fit items are not significant in equation (3), which indicates that there is no significant influence of other factors in this experiment. 
The model is appropriate and the lack of fit is denied. 
The regressive items are significant at the 0.01 level, which indicates that the selected four factors have significantly affected the fermentation yield of Phellinus Linteus. 
The determination coefficient R-square[7] of the equation is 95.21% and the correction determination coefficient Adj. 
R-square is 84.03%. 
Both of them are higher, which shows that the credibility of this model is higher and it fits well with the actual situation. 
Then, the changes of the test can be better explained. 
In order to further analyze the influence of the equation on indicators, it is required to conduct the t-test for each coefficient in regression equation (3). 
The results can be shown in Table 4. Tab.

At the same time, when the actual variables are substituted, the regression equation will be obtained, which can be shown as follows:      \   [  [  [ [  [  [ [ [ (4) 2.3 The model analysis and discussion (1) Analysis of main effect As the factors in this design have been conducted the dimensionless linear encoder processing and there is no relationship between the first item regression coefficient b j and the regression coefficients of interaction items and quadratic items, the absolute value of the regression coefficient can directly compare the influence of the first item of each factor on the mycelium fermentation yield. 
From formula (3), it is found that the factor that affects the fermentation yield most is the fermentation temperature, followed by the inoculum size, the rotation speed and the bottling volume. 
(2) Analysis of interaction effect From formula (3), it is found that z1z2 is the only significant interaction item, which indicates that there exists a significant interaction between the inoculum size and the bottling capacity. 
When the bottling capacity is lower, the inoculum size will be increased. 
The fermentation yield of Phellinus Linteus is slowly increased and it has been decreased in some intervals. 
When the bottling capacity is higher, the fermentation yield of Phellinus Linteus will be rapidly increased with the increase of inoculum size, which is more in line with the actual production situation. 
(3) Simulation optimization of the optimum fermentation conditions It is required to conduct the solver through the encoding. 
The theoretical extreme value of fermentation mycelium production is 24.51mg/mL. 
The corresponding optimal fermentation conditions are: the bottling volume is 120mL, the inoculum size is 17mL, the temperature is 26ć and the rotation speed is 135r/min. 
(4) Experiment verification of optimizing conditions The verification experiments should be performed in the optimal fermentation conditions. 
The mycelium yield is 24.47r0.8(n=3)mg/mL, which is consistent with the theoretical value.
