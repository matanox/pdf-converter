1. Introduction Although life expectancy has steadily increased over recent decades in Europe, substantial inequalities in health remain for older men and women (Mc Munn, Breeze, Goodman, & Nazroo, 2006). 
Thus, for many people recent increases in life expectancy are accompanied by extended periods of morbidity or disability. 
In a context of rapidly ageing societies, these health inequalities at older ages have signiﬁcant implications for European social policies. 
Additional scientiﬁc research is needed to identify the determinants of health in older ages. 
Whereas descriptive evidence of health inequalities in older ages is convincing, the explanations given so far are limited. 
In particular, core questions remain unanswered, e.g. to what extent do conditions during earlier stages of the life course, such as mid-life working conditions, contribute towards explaining health variations among men and women in later life (Elder & Johnson, 2002; Siegrist & Marmot, 2006)? 
For instance, it can be assumed that older people with poor A R T I C L E I N F O Article history: Received 29 May 2012 Received in revised form 20 October 2012 Accepted 22 October 2012 Keywords: Depressive symptoms Mid-life Working conditions Life course SHARELIFE A B S T R A C T This article illustrates the importance of previous working conditions during mid-life (between 40 and 55) for mental health among older retired men and women (60 or older) across 13 European countries. 
We link information on health from the second wave (2006– 2007) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) with information on respondents’ working life collected retrospectively in the SHARELIFE interview (2008– 2009). 
To measure working conditions, we rely on core assumptions of existing theoretical models of work stress (the demand–control–support and the effort–reward imbalance model) and distinguish four types of unhealthy working conditions: (1) a stressful psychosocial work environment (as assessed by the two work stress models) (2) a disadvantaged occupational position throughout the whole period of mid-life, (3) experience of involuntary job loss, and (4) exposure to job instability. 
Health after labour market exit is measured using depressive symptoms, as measured by the EURO-D depression scale. 
Main results show that men and women who experienced psychosocial stress at work or had low occupational positions during mid-life had signiﬁcantly higher probabilities of high depressive symptoms during retirement. 
Additionally, men with unstable working careers and an involuntary job loss were at higher risks to report high depressive symptoms in later life. 
These associations remain signiﬁcant after controlling for workers’ health and social position prior mid-life. 
These ﬁndings support the assumption that mental health of retirees who experienced poor working conditions during mid-life is impaired.

health experienced more disadvantaged working conditions, and that these conditions may have had an impact on their health later on. When looking at previous studies concerned with working conditions in mid-life and health, two shortcomings are apparent: ﬁrst, the analytical time frame of a majority of studies is restricted to a short period of observation, without extension into stages where people are retired (Dragano, Siegrist, & Wahrendorf, 2011; Stansfeld, Fuhrer, Shipley, & Marmot, 1999). 
This state of the art, with some noticeable exceptions (Melchior et al., 2006; Westerlund et al., 2009), contrasts with recent evidence on the importance of early life and mid-life conditions in explaining health at old age (Blane, 2006; Power & Kuh, 2006). 
A second weakness of existing studies on work and health concerns the measurement of workrelated factors, which is often restricted to one single time point of the working life and which lacks a conceptual basis (particular in case of psychosocial working conditions), thus preventing the comparability and cumulative knowledge of respective ﬁndings (for reviews see for example Antoniou & Cooper, 2005). 
Current knowledge about a health-adverse psychosocial work environment mainly builds on two theoretical models of work stress, the demand–control–support model (Karasek & Theorell, 1990) and the effort–reward imbalance model (Siegrist, 1996). 
These models may be helpful in describing unhealthy working conditions throughout mid-life and, thus, to contribute to a better understanding of the afﬂictions of work on later health (see Section 1.1 for details). 
In short, to explain health inequalities in older ages there is strong need to consider the life course by including conditions of earlier life, such as working conditions during mid-life. 
Moreover, a theorybased approach towards measuring mid-life working conditions is needed. 
This paper tries to overcome these limitations by using data from two waves of the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) containing data from 13 European countries (Bo¨rsch-Supan et al., 2005). 
More speciﬁcally, we combine second wave data with information on health (collected in 2006–2007) and retrospective information on individual working life provided in the third wave of SHARE, called SHARELIFE (collected in 2008– 2009). 
In the following paragraphs, we elaborate our theoretical perspective in more detail and describe existing evidence related to our research. 
1.1. 
Theoretical considerations Mid-life is considered as an important stage of the life course with long-term effects on standard of living and health in later life (Willis & Mar tin, 2005). 
This is mainly due to the fact that mid-life is the stage of life where highest levels of individual responsibilities are required (Willis, Martin, & Rocke, 2010). 
In terms of age, this time can be deﬁned as the period between 40 and 55 years. 
During mid -life, core social roles (e.g. parenting, work) are acquired and executed, with opportunities of experiencing success and failure in pursuing imp ortant goals and in satisfying major material and non-material needs. 
Among these latter needs a sense of belonging to relevant social networks (Berkman & Glass, 2000), a continued experience of agency and autono my (Haidt & Rodin, 1999), and a recurrent experience of social recognition for personal achievements (Siegrist, 2005) are of particular importance for health and well-being. 
In this context, the quality of people’s psychosocial work environment is of outstanding signiﬁcance, given the centrality of work in mid-life. 
These ideas lie at the core of the two work stress models mentioned above (the demand–control–support and the effort–reward imbalance model). 
However, their application so far has been mostly restricted to a single measurement point. 
It was therefore not possible to explore to what extent these models can be used to ana lyse working conditions and employment trajectories throughout mid -life. 
In order to deﬁne working conditions in mid-life from the perspective of these two models, we brieﬂy describe the models in more detail including recent applications, and then present our research question. 
The demand–control–support model was developed by Karasek (1979) and extended by Karasek and Theorell (1990) and by Johnson and Hall (1988). 
It posits that jobs with high psychological demands, low levels of autonomy and decision latitude (low control) and low social support at work are stressful and adversely affect health. 
This is due to the fact that these jobs limit the experience of autonomy at work, while exerting continued pressure. 
As a complementary work stress model, the effort–reward imbalance model (Siegrist, 1996) addresses the work contract and the principle of social reciprocity lying at its core. 
Rewards received in return to efforts spent at work include money, esteem, and career opportunities (job promotion and job security). 
The model proposes that the frustration of legitimate rewards (effort–reward imbalance) generates strong negative emotions and psychobiological stress responses with adverse long-term effects on health. 
Taken together, both work stress models cover different, but equally relevant aspects of the workplace, where lack of control and lack of reward matter most. Several empirical studies demonstrate the importance of either model for health and well-being in a biopsychosocial perspective, as summarized in a number of systematic reviews using different health outcomes, including stress-related disorders (Nieuwenhuijsen, Bruinvels, & Frings-Dresen, 2010), mental disorders (Schnall, Dobson, & Rosskam, 2009; Stansfeld & Candy, 2006), and coronary heart diseases (Kivimaki et al., 2006; Steptoe & Kivimaki, 2012). 
In addition, studies indicate that levels of exposures and health-related effects differ between men and women (Messing et al., 2003). 
For instance, based on the British Whitehall Study, Stansfeld et al. (1999) found that effects of work stress on depressive symptoms are stronger for men compared to women – a result that can be attributed to a higher signiﬁcance of the work role for men compared to women, as well as to the availability of alternative roles (e.g. family) among women. 
Furthermore, levels of exposure are different (e.g. higher control and more strenuous jobs for men), because men tend to work longer, in different sectors and generally higher occupational positions (Eurofound, 2007). 
In this perspective, the following analyses will be conducted for men and women separately. 
In the dataset described below information on core dimensions of these two models is available for the main occupation during mid-life (see Section 2.2 for details). 
In addition to these data, a new element will be added by using information on individuals’ work history during midlife. 
More speciﬁcally, we delineate working conditions in terms of those psychosocial aspects of the job career that may prevent the continued experience of control and reward during mid-life (Siegrist, 2009). 
As an example, we maintain that a disadvantaged occupational position throughout mid-life (preventing any upward mobility) elicits recurrent negative emotions and stress reactions due to the continued frustration of experiencing social reward. 
The feeling of not getting anywhere despite one’s efforts may trigger a sense of being locked in a totally unrewarding social environment. 
Cumulative and chronic experiences of failed promotion prospects and related circumstances of relative deprivation may exert adverse long-term effects on mental and emotional well-being. 
Similar consequences are expected in case of involuntary job loss and job instability during mid-life, for example discontinued, fragmented working careers or periods of unemployment (Bambra & Eikemo, 2009; Bartley, Ferrie, & Montgomery, 2006; Thomas, Benzeval, & Stansfeld, 2005). 
We maintain that this approach extends the current research paradigm of occupational epidemiology. 
Moreover, it highlights how established work stress models can be used to analyse potential long-term effects on health due to speciﬁc characteristics of people’s work histories. 
Taken together, this paper studies associations between working conditions in mid-life and mental health after retirement for men and women. 
Working conditions will be measured in terms of speciﬁc characteristics of the work history and the exposure to psychosocial stress at work, as deﬁned by the effort–reward imbalance and the demand– control model. 
2. Methods 2.1. 
Data sources For our analyses, we combined second wave data of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 2006 to 2007 with information on health, with third wave data collected in 2008–2009 (SHARELIFE), where mid-life working conditions were assessed retrospectively. 
SHARE is the ﬁrst cross-national research project comparing data on health, quality of life, social and socio-economic conditions among older people in European countries (see www.share-project.org for details). 
By combining these two waves of SHARE, it is possible to analyse associations between working conditions (assessed retrospectively) and health in older ages across 13 European countries, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark (DK) and Sweden (SE)), Central Europe (Austria (AT), France (FR), Germany (DE), Switzerland (CH), Belgium (BE), and the Netherlands (NL)), Mediterranean countries (Spain (ES), Italy (IT) and Greece (GR)) and two Eastern European transition countries (the Czech Republic (CZ) and Poland (PL)). 
In all countries, data collection is based on probability household samples where all people above 50 years plus their (possibly younger) partners were interviewed using Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). 
For the analyses, we restricted the sample to all people who already left the labour market in wave 2 (at time of health assessment) and reported to be employed at least once during mid-life. 
This serves our aim to study the inﬂuence of mid-life working conditions on health in older ages. 
Furthermore, there are restrictions necessary to avoid that results are related to sample composition. 
First, in order to minimize the effect of ill health causing both speciﬁc working careers (e.g. periods of unemployment or downward mobility) and the report of poor health during retirement, all men and women with a period of long term sickness absence during working life (lasting at least 6 months) were excluded from the analyses. 
Second, to avoid an over-selection of respondents with an early exit from the labour market (probably with poorer health conditions) only respondents aged 60 or older when retired were selected. 
Finally, respondents who had difﬁculties to respond to the retrospective questionnaire (4%) were not included either to prevent biased information on work histories. 
These restrictions resulted in a ﬁnal sample with full available data of 4822 men and 3787 women born between 1908 and 1947. 
2.2. 
Measures 2.2.1. 
Mid-life working conditions The third wave of SHARE contains an extensive module on the individual work history. 
These data are collected retrospectively using a lifegrid method, where respondent’s working life is represented graphically by a grid that is ﬁlled in the course of the interview. 
This method was developed ﬁrst for use in the Boyd Orr Cohort as a selfcompletion questionnaire (Blane, 1996); with subsequent development of a CAPI version by UK National Centre for Social Research (Scholes et al., 2009) which was adopted for SHARELIFE (Schro¨der, 2011a). 
The module collects information on each job a respondent had during his or her working career, together with details on each period when the respondent was not employed (if the respective period lasted 6 months or longer). 
Information on jobs includes a measure of the occupational position and a description of the psychosocial work environment (for the last main job of the working career). 
Information on periods when the respondent was not employed includes a description of the situation (e.g. unemployed, sickness absence, domestic work, etc.). 
Moreover, each time the respondents left a job, the reason was assessed (e.g. being laid off, retired). 
By combining these data, we can provide speciﬁc descriptions of occupational careers and reasons of their discontinuity, thus shedding light on the entire work history in terms of employment situations across each age period. 
To illustrate the richness of information evolving from this data, Fig. 1 presents the frequencies of different employment situations over the work life for the sample under study, separately for men and women. 
It clearly shows that working careers vary substantially between men and women, with higher labour market participation (mostly full-time employment) and no domestic work for men compared to women—a result that further supports our approach of conducting analyses separately. 
For the following analyses, we concentrate on mid-life and the lifespan between the age of 40 and 55 (Willis & Martin, 2005). 
In line with our theoretical considerations we distinguish the following four types of mid-life working conditions: (1) a stressful psychosocial work environment (as assessed by the two work stress models) (2) a disadvantaged occupational position throughout the whole period of mid-life, (3) experience of involuntary job loss, and (4) exposure to job instability. 
(1) Psychosocial stress during mid-life: To measure the exposure to psychosocial stress at work during midlife, ﬁve binary indicators of poor psychosocial working conditions were computed, based on 11 questionnaire items (4-point Likert scaled) taken from established work stress measures. 
These measures refer to the main job of the working career, with a mean length of 22 years in our sample. 
Each indicator corresponds to a core dimension of the two work stress models described above and was taken from original questionnaires (Karasek et al., 1998; Siegrist et al., 2004): physical demands (2 items), psychosocial demands (3 items), social support at work (2 items), control at work (2 items), and reward (2 items). 
All items are displayed in Appendix A. For the analyses, we calculated a simple sum-score for each dimension, with higher scores indicating higher work stress. 
Each measure was transformed into a binary indicator, where participants scoring in the upper tertile of the respective measure were considered to experience stress at work. 
(2) Disadvantaged occupational position throughout midlife: We used two indicators of a disadvantaged occupational position throughout mid-life based on respondents’ occupational positions held between the age of 40 and 55, ﬁrst, the mean occupational position held during mid-life, and second, the extent of intragenerational social mobility during mid-life. 
In SHARELIFE, occupational positions were assessed according to the ten main occupational groups of the International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupation (ISCO), developed by the International Labour Ofﬁce (1990). 
For the analyses, these groups were further reduced to the four different skill-levels representing the broad hierarchical structure of the ISCO classiﬁcation, where higher skill levels are related to higher occupational positions. 
For the ﬁrst indicator, the mean skill level during midlife was calculated, by summing up the available skill levels for each year in mid-life divided by number of years in employment. 
By rounding up or down the resulting mean scores, respondents were regrouped to the four skill levels (very low: 1st skill level; low: 2nd skill level; high: 3rd skill level; very high: 4th skill level). 
For our second indicator (social mobility), the skill level of respondents’ occupation at the age of 40 (or ﬁrst job after 40 if not employed at age 40) was compared to the last main job of the working career. 
On this basis, four categories were deﬁned (1) continuous high position (3rd or 4th skill level), (2) continuous low position (1st or 2nd skill level), (3) upward mobility, and (4) downward mobility). 
To avoid misspeciﬁcations, only jobs lasting at least two years were considered for this procedure. 
(3) Involuntary job loss: We used one binary indicator to measure an involuntary job loss during mid-life, measuring whether the respondent left a job because of being laid off. 
(4) Job instability: Two relevant indicators are based on individuals’ employment situations between 40 and 55, Fig. 1. Employment situation by age for men and women (N = 8609). 
as displayed in Fig. 1. By further applying descriptive techniques of sequence analysis (Brzinsky-Fay & Kohler, 2010), we derived two binary indicators of job instability, measuring (1) whether the respondent experienced an episode of unemployment during midlife (lasting at least 6 months), and (2) whether the respondent was exposed to a discontinued, fragmented working career (in terms of frequent (3 or more) job changes or in terms of staying in paid employment for less than 10 years during mid-life). 
2.2.2. 
Health Our main measure of mental health was a binary indicator of depressive symptoms. 
This measure was deﬁned on the basis of the EURO-D depression scale (Prince et al., 1999). 
The EURO-D depression scale includes 12-items asking about the presence of depressive symptoms, with higher values reﬂecting more symptoms. 
For our analyses we used the cut-point of three (more than 3 symptoms) indicating a clinically relevant condition of depressive symptoms. 
While this cut-point does not meet the standards of a physician-based diagnosis of depression, it was nevertheless shown to be a valid and consistent indicator of elevated levels of depressive symptoms in a cross-European study (Prince et al., 1999). 
2.2.3. Additional variables We included a number of additional individual measures, in particular as confounders within the multivariate analyses. 
In addition to age, we included two variables related to childhood circumstances which were also measured in the retrospective survey and may both inﬂuence working careers and health in later life: ﬁrst, an indicator of socioeconomic circumstances, measured by the number of reported books in the household when the respondent was ten years old, and second a measure of health during childhood (self-reported poor health as a child at the age of ten). 
2.2.4. 
Analyses All analyses were conducted separately for men and women. 
First, after a basic description of mid-life working conditions (Table 1), we studied the prevalence of increased depressive symptoms according to working conditions (Table 2). Next, we calculated multilevel logistic regression models (random intercept only) for binary dependent variables to estimate the probability of increased depressive symptoms according to mid-life working conditions, with individuals (level 1) nested within countries (level 2) (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2010). 
By using multilevel modelling, accurate adjustment for country afﬁliation is possible, and the dependence of residuals within a country is considered, since the constant is allowed to vary across countries. 
Moreover, likelihood ratio tests were performed comparing the multilevel models to ordinary logistic regression and revealed better model ﬁts in all cases. 
Regression models are presented for each measure of working conditions (Table 3), one for men Table 1 Description of measures and frequencies (N = 8609).

Importantly, all models include relevant confounders, such as age, childhood social position and prior health status. 
In the results, we present odds ratios and levels of signiﬁcance. 
All calculations were done using STATA 11. 3. Results 3.1. 
Descriptive ﬁndings The sample of participants with full data consisted of 4822 men (mean age: 70.6 years) and 3787 women (mean age: 70.2). 
The mean number of observation across countries was 662, with smallest number in Austria (314) and largest number in Belgium (945). 
In Table 1, all measures of mid-life working conditions and their frequencies are reported, separately for men and women. 
With regard to our ﬁve indicators of psychosocial stress at work, we found somewhat higher rates of physical and psychosocial demands amongst men, and somewhat higher rates of low work control and low reward among women. 
Turning to the mean occupational position, women tended to have achieved lower occupational positions during mid-life than men. 
Mobility during mid-life was low for men and women. 
Rates of an involuntary job loss were as low as around 4% for men and women. 
Most respondents of our sample experienced rather stable working arrangements during mid-life, with low rates of unemployment episodes (longer than 6 months), and low levels of fragmented working careers (speciﬁcally for men). 
These latter ﬁndings support our notion that measuring chronic psychosocial stress experienced in one’s main occupation during mid-life is particularly useful to test the study hypotheses. 
Are mid-life working conditions associated with increased depressive symptoms after labour market exit? 
Table 2 gives a preliminary answer to these questions, presenting frequencies of increased depressive symptoms according to working conditions. 
Concerning an adverse psychosocial work environment during mid-life, men and women who experienced stressful work during mid-life were more likely to report increased depressive symptoms in later life. 
Strongest associations are observed for men with low level of control and for women with low level of social support at work. 
Furthermore, Table 2 demonstrates a clear-cut social gradient of depressive symptoms, where levels of depressive symptoms were lower amongst those who had worked in higher social positions. 
Moreover, Table 2 shows that people who were locked in a low position during their whole mid-life career and those who experienced downward mobility were more likely to report high depressive symptoms after exit from labour market. 
In case of involuntary job loss, results show higher frequencies of depressive symptoms amongst those who had been laid off during mid-life. 
Finally, the experience of an episode of unemployment (for men only) and of a Table 2 Frequencies of high depressive symptoms (EURO-D) according to mid-life working conditions (N = 8609).

As exempliﬁed in Fig. 2, ﬁndings were conﬁrmed at the level of countries, using low reward at work as an indicator for men and women. 
3.2. 
Multivariate ﬁndings In a next step, multilevel models were calculated to test the signiﬁcance of the described associations between working conditions and depressive symptoms, once important confounders were taken into account. 
Results of these analyses are given in Table 3, where odds ratios and levels of statistical signiﬁcance are indicated for each measure of mid-life working conditions. 
In case of the ﬁve indicators of psychosocial stress during mid-life and the two measures of a disadvantage occupational position throughout mid-life, results conﬁrm our descriptive ﬁndings both for men and women. 
Even after taking into account workers’ health conditions and social position before mid-life, we observe signiﬁcantly higher probabilities of reporting increased depressive symptoms amongst people who reported stress at work during mid-life or who worked in low occupational positions during this period of life. 
In case of involuntary job loss and job instability we found signiﬁcant results for men only. 
Again, men who had been laid off, who Table 3 Association between mid-life working conditions and high depressive symptoms in older ages: results of multilevel logistic regression analyses (odds ratios and signiﬁcance levels, N = 8609).

experienced a period of unemployment, or who were exposed to fragmented working careers were at higher risk of reporting increased depressive symptoms after labour market exit. 
This observation supports our hypothesis of associations between working conditions in mid-life and depressive symptoms in later life. 
4. Discussion With this contribution we set out to study the longterm inﬂuences of working conditions in mid-life on mental health after labour market exit, using information on respondents’ working life that was collected retrospectively in the SHARELIFE interview. 
Working conditions were deﬁned and measured on the basis of established models of work stress, speciﬁcally the demand–control– support model and the effort–reward imbalance model. 
On the one hand we used items taken from original questionnaires to measures core dimensions of the two stress models, and on the other hand we derived a variety of speciﬁc characteristics of the work history by extending core stress-theoretical assumptions to mid-life working careers. 
Taken together, we distinguished four types of working conditions: (1) a stressful psychosocial work environment (as assessed by the two work stress models), (2) a disadvantaged occupational position throughout the whole period of mid-life, (3) experience of involuntary job loss, and (4) exposure to job instability. 
Given the expected sex differences of working conditions in mid-life and their inﬂuence on later health, all analyses were conducted separately for men and women. 
Main results can be summarized as follows: ﬁrst, we found important variations of working conditions between men and women. 
While rates of physical and psychosocial demands were higher for men, women were more likely to experience low work control and low reward at work. 
Moreover, men had generally higher occupational positions in mid-life and tended to have more stable working careers. 
Second, we found strong evidence that people who experienced poor working conditions during mid-life are more likely to report elevated levels of depressive symptoms during retirement. 
However, results differed according to type of working conditions under study as well as according to sex. 
Experiencing psychosocial stress at work and being conﬁned to disadvantaged occupational positions during mid-life were associated with elevated risk of reporting depressive symptoms after labour market exit both among men and women, with strongest associations for men with low level of control and for women with low level of social support at work. 
In case of the remaining working conditions, signiﬁcant associations with depressive symptoms were found for men only. 
Here, involuntary job loss and job instability during mid-life were signiﬁcantly associated with later increased depressive symptoms. 
These associations remained signiﬁcant after controlling for workers’ health conditions and social position prior to mid-life. 
Taken together, these results are in line with studies documenting an increased risk of stress-related and mental disorders among people who are exposed to adverse working conditions during mid-life, whether in terms of poor psychosocial work environment (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2010; Stansfeld & Candy, 2006) or labour market disadvantages (Bambra & Eikemo, 2009; Bartley et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2005). 
Moreover, results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings of a long-term impact of working conditions on later health (Schro ¨ der, 2011b; Siegrist & Wahrendorf, 2010; Wahrendorf et al., 2012; Schro¨der, in this issue), but add a new element to its explanation by focussing on mid-life working conditions and testing their long-term associations with mental health following working life. 
Importantly, in contrast to preceding studies, we choose a theory-driven approach, ﬁrst, by highlighting mid-life as a stage of the life course with critical challenges of fulﬁlling needs and meeting responsibilities, and second, by identifying particular unhealthy working conditions over a longer time period of the life course, applying stresstheoretical notions of control and reward. 
Our results support this approach and underline that disadvantaged working conditions, as measured in this study, contribute towards explaining mental health in later life. 
Moreover, results support the assumption that level of exposure and its effect on mental health vary between men and women, as indicated in previous studies (Eurofound, 2007; Stansfeld et al., 1999). 
Alternative explanations and further mechanisms must be considered when discussing the results. 
First, while our study and the proposed theoretical framework focus on the psychobiological stress responses to a disadvantaged work environment, additional conditions, such as poverty and health-damaging behaviours, may help to explain the observed associations (Bartley et al., 2006). 
Furthermore, selection into unfavourable jobs during earlier stages of the life course due to reduced health may exert an indirect effect on poor mental health later on. Finally, unfavourable working conditions in mid-life were shown to increase poor physical health in later life (Siegrist & Wahrendorf, 2010; Wahrendorf et al., 2012), which in turn may reduce mental well-being during retirement. 
Several limitations must be considered. 
First, although we conducted gender-speciﬁc analyses in view of differential patterns of labour market participation, we did not analyse additional factors which may modify the shape of working trajectories and associated health risks. 
For instance, a growing body of research explores the impact of distinct national welfare state policies on a country’s quality of work and employment (Bambra & Eikemo, 2009; Dragano et al., 2011). 
Some ﬁndings of this research suggest that favourable national labour market policies (e.g. high degree of investments in rehabilitative care or in adult education and training programmes) to some extent can mitigate the adverse effects on health and well-being attributed to stressful working conditions in these countries. 
Similar, further analyses may invest if the observed differences between men and women exist for all countries. 
A second limitation is given by the fact that our analyses are restricted to a sample of retirees born between 1908 and 1947, representing generations with speciﬁc working careers and values. 
Therefore, the results may not be generalized to more recent generations of working men and women. 
In terms of life course theory it is important to keep in mind that the experience of working conditions does not only vary according to a speciﬁc life stage, but additionally according to the historical period in which these conditions are shaped and experienced (Elder & Johnson, 2002). 
Therefore, the signiﬁcance of our results for a workforce which has been – and continues to be – exposed to more recent changes of work and employment in the context of a globalized economy remains to be evaluated in future studies. 
A third limitation relates to the measurement of our core variables within the constraints of this study design. 
Although working conditions and depressive symptoms have been measured at different time points, we are not able to rule out a reporting bias of our data measuring working conditions. 
Importantly, a depressive mood may inﬂuence how working conditions during mid-life are interpreted and experienced in retrospect. 
Yet, while this may be critical in the case of our assessment of psychosocial stress at work there is less concern about bias in case of descriptive information about one’s working career (occupational position, involuntary job loss, job stability). 
Furthermore, it should be noted that recent analyses using health measures with less susceptibility to generate biased information, such as health functioning, chronic health conditions or reported symptoms, revealed associations of similar strength between psychosocial work stress and health after labour market exit (Siegrist & Wahrendorf, 2010; Wahrendorf et al., 2012), thus strengthening our theoretical approach. 
We should also keep in mind that we restricted our sample by excluding people who reported a period of major sickness absence during working life and by focussing on people aged 60 or older. 
Moreover, controlling for negative affectivity would perhaps have improved the validity of our ﬁndings. 
Yet, respective information was not available and previous analyses of its effect on associations of self-report measures of stressful work with health found relatively weak impact (Bosma, Peter, Siegrist, & Marmot, 1998; Stansfeld et al., 1999). 
A ﬁnal limitation concerns the measurement of psychosocial stress at work which was limited to one major – although highly representative – job during midlife. 
Furthermore, due to ﬁnancial and time constraints of cross-national epidemiological studies (such as SHARE) a full test of the original scales of the two work stress models was not feasible. 
Therefore, abbreviated measure had to be applied. 
However, previous studies documented that short versions of these work stress models successfully contribute towards explaining associations of work stress with mental health (Dragano et al., 2011; Siegrist, Wahrendorf, von dem Knesebeck, Ju ¨ rges, & Bo ¨ rsch-Supan, 2006). 
These limitations are balanced by several strengths. 
First, the SHARE study meets high quality standards of data collection, speciﬁcally a vigorously controlled study protocol, the application of validated questionnaires, and the observation of standard procedures of translating the measures into different languages and of collecting and controlling the data (Bo¨rsch-Supan & Ju¨rges, 2005). 
Second, we applied a theoretically grounded approach to measure working conditions. 
Third, by considering the hierarchical struct ure of our data in the multilevel analysis (individual nested within countries), we allowed for an accurate adjustment of country afﬁliation. 
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate robust associations of working conditions in mid-life and depressive symptoms after labour market exit. 
Our ﬁndings support the not ion that work-related int erventions and related employment policies should target more explicitly mid-life as a critical period, given its signiﬁcance for health and well-being in later stages of the life course.
