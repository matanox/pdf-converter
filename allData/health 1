1 Furthermore, obesity can cause a number of serious medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, pregnancy complications, osteoarthritis, and stroke. 
1 To address the trend of obesity in the United States, effective strategies that prevent the initial onset of weight gain are paramount. 
A new approach to aberrant eating is the application of mindfulness or the practice of “paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.” 2 Mindfulness training has the potential to increase one’s awareness of aspects of eating that could prevent overconsumption. 
For example, mindfulness skills can be applied to help individuals recognize urges to engage in nonbiologically-driven eating prompted by internal (eg, emotions) or external (eg, presence of food in the

Additionally, by being more mindful, individuals may better attend to cues of hunger, fullness, and satiety, resulting in decreased overconsumption. 
Mindfulness-based training for individuals with disordered eating has led to positive changes in trait mindfulness, 3,4 awareness of eating patterns, 5,6 and awareness of hunger and fullness cues. 
3 Preliminary studies suggest they may also be of benefit to those individuals who wish to maintain a healthy weight. 
7 Given the potential efficacy of mindfulness for weight management in individuals without eating disorders, the current pilot study sought to examine whether participation in a one-time session of mindfulness training would increase mindfulness and healthy foodconsumption behaviors in undergraduate students without eating disorders. 
METHOD Participants Undergraduate students were recruited from psychology classes and through flyers posted at an urban, northeastern, Catholic university. 
To decrease the chance the participants would unintentionally act in ways that would confirm the researchers’ hypotheses (eg, engage in healthy consumption), individuals were informed that the study was a stressmanagement training. 
Those individuals with food allergies, an inability to fast, or a current or past eating-disorder diagnosis were not eligible to participate. 
Procedures Participants completed an online battery of measures 1 day to 2 weeks prior to the training and were asked to fast for 3 hours prior to arriving at the training. 
The 1-hour training included didactic and experiential components and was administered in a group format, with five to eight participants per group. 
The first author, an advanced doctoral student at the time, led the trainings according to a written protocol; she had participated in previous mindfulness trainings and had experience in mindfulness and mindful-eating instruction. 
During the course of the training, she led three experiential mindfulness exercises adapted from Segal et al 8 that included mindful breathing; a sitting meditation focusing on breathing, body sensations, sounds, and thoughts; and a mindful-eating meditation. 
At the conclusion of the training, participants were seated at private eating stations and were asked to apply the skills they had just learned during lunch, which included one 12-inch (30.5 cm) sandwich, condiments, an apple, an orange, a chocolate chip cookie, a serving of potato chips, one can of diet cola, and one bottle of water (about 2000 total calories). 
After 20 minutes, participants were invited to continue to eat at their private stations, or if finished, to complete posttraining measures. 
Outcome Measures Pre- and posttraining, the research team used (1) the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) to measure state mindfulness, 9 (2) the Awareness subscale of the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS-AW) to measure presentmoment awareness, 10 and (3) the Acting with Awareness subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-AW) to measure mealtime awareness. 
11 The TMS is a 13-item, self-report measure of state mindfulness consisting of two subscales, Curiosity and Decentering. 
The scale’s possible total scores range from 0 to 52. The scale has been shown to provide a reliable assessment of changes in mindfulness following training and practice. 
The PHLMS is a 20-item, self-report measure of trait mindfulness comprised of two subscales, Awareness and Acceptance. 
Only the Awareness subscale (10 items) was used in the current study’s data analysis. 
The subscale’s possible scores range from 10 to 50 and internal consistency for the subscale is adequate (Cronbach α = .75). 10 The FFMQ is a 39-item, self-report questionnaire that measures trait mindfulness across five facets: Observing, Describing, Acting with Awareness, Nonjudgment, and Nonreactivity. 
Due to the lack of mindful-eating measures available to assess mealtime awareness, the research team modified the original directions for the Acting with Awareness subscale for the current study. 
At pretraining, participants were asked to indicate what is generally true for them when they eat a meal. At posttraining, participants were asked to indicate what was true for them during the past meal. The subscale’s scores range from 0 to 40. Good internal consistency (α = .87) has been documented for this subscale. 
11 Social desirability was examined using the MarloweCrowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS), 12 a 33-item, true/ false, self-report measure. 
This variable was examined as a covariate during data analysis to account for socially desirable responding (the tendency for individuals to behave based on how they assume the researchers want them to behave). 
Strong internal consistency (α = .88) and test-retest reliability (I = .89) has been found for the MCSDS in a healthy, collegestudent population. 
12 In addition, the research team administered two 7-point Likert scales posttraining to assess hunger/fullness (0 = very hungry to 7 = very full) and meal palatability (0 = dislike a lot to 7 = like a lot). 
In the hunger/fullness scale’s design, ratings between 2.5 and 5.5 indicate healthy consumption, ratings greater than 5.5 indicate overconsumption, and ratings below 2.5 indicate underconsumption. 
13 Similar palatability ratings are common in food laboratory studies, such as de Castro, Bellisle, and Dalix’s study in 2000. 
14 The Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS) is a 22-item, self-report measure that assesses the presence of bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and anorexia nervosa (AN). 
To ensure that the current study was restricted to individuals without an eating disorder, the research team used this measure to identify those individuals who met criteria for an eating disorder. 
Research studies indicate good validity and reliability for the EDDS. 
15 A qualitative questionnaire was also given posttraining to assess participants’ reactions to the training.

27, NO. 2Jacobs—Mindful Eating RESULTS Participants Thirty-five participants enrolled in and attended the training. 
Nine of the 35 participants were excluded from data analysis because they (1) had an eating-disorder diagnosis, (2) had food allergies, (3) did not consume the lunch, or (4) had results that were data outliers (ie, their scores were more than two standard deviations from the mean on one or more measures). 
Twenty females (77%) and six males (23%) were included in the data analyses. 
See Table 1 and Table 2 for additional demographic information and descriptive statistics. 
The body mass index (BMI) was determined through self-reported height and weight; approximately 62% were classified as having a healthy weight, with the remaining 38% classified as mildly to moderately underweight. 
Fortysix percent of the sample reported experience with mindfulness or meditation (eg, yoga, martial arts, Buddhism); however, no significant differences existed on any of the outcome measures when those participants with or without experience were compared. 
Although seven participants indicated that they had a nominal amount to eat or drink in the 3 hours before the 1-hour training (eg, a sip of soda, a piece of gum), all remaining participants reported complete adherence to the fast. The mean palatability rating of the lunch was 5.65 (SD = 1.00), indicating that participants on average mildly to moderately liked the meal. Repeated measures analyses of covariance (RM-ANCOVA) were used to measure changes in state mindfulness, present-moment awareness, and mealtime awareness from pre- to posttraining while controlling for the covariate, social desirability. 
Social desirability had no influence on any of the findings. 
Descriptive statistics and effect sizes, reported as partial eta squared (η  p ), are listed in Table 2. Small, medium, and large treatment effects are commonly identified by η  p effect size magnitudes, which are .01, .06, and .14, respectively. 
16 A statistically significant increase in state mindfulness (TMS) was found from pre- to posttraining (F 1, 24 = 12.36, P = .002, η  p = .34).

Twentythree participants engaged in healthy levels of consumption (ratings ranged from 2.5-5.5, mean = 4.71, SD = 0.84). The remaining three participants engaged in unhealthy consumption, as indicated by ratings of 6.0 (“slight discomfort from over fullness”). 
Inspection of the posttraining, qualitative questionnaire revealed a number of interesting findings. 
Twenty-five participants indicated that they enjoyed the training and expressed interest in additional mindfulness training. 
Participants reported being mindful of many aspects of their bodies and their food during the meal (Table 4). Finally, individuals’ reflections about their experiences indicated an ability to grasp the concepts of mindfulness during the training (eg, one participant noted, “Instead of rushing through things at the normal mindless pace, today slowed me down [almost to a standstill] and made me recognize my experiences;” another wrote,“I remembered we learned ‘why judge?’ So I let go of the judging and ate what I wanted to eat. 
I didn’t judge anyone else or even myself ”). DISCUSSION The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether a one-time session of mindfulness training could promote mindful eating in students who did not have an eating disorder.

27, NO. 2Jacobs—Mindful Eating pre- to posttraining and the rate of healthy consumption (86%) provided preliminary support that a brief session of mindfulness training can have an immediate effect in changing habitual responses to oneself and the environment (eg, food). 
Even though mindful eating and healthy consumption are not mutually exclusive (ie, one can overeat mindfully or mindlessly consume a healthy amount of food), qualitative results from the current study suggested that the participants were aware of various aspects of eating, which may have prevented overconsumption. 
These aspects included (1) biological hunger, (2) fullness, (3) satisfaction from each food, and (4) features of the food’s appearance. 
This finding was consistent with similar findings of greater eating awareness, eating control, and satiety awareness following MB-EAT, an 8-week program designed to target disordered eating. 
3 As previously discussed, a tendency exists for the general US population to engage in excess eating in response to nonbiological food cues, such as external cues in the environment (externality theory) 17 and emotional stress (psychosomatic theory). 
18 Given our offering of a highcalorie meal and the high stress from final exams that most participants described feeling in the posttraining questionnaire, the current study was able to examine eating Table 4.

27. NO. 2 23Jacobs—Mindful Eating in response to environmental factors and mood states that have been associated with eating in the absence of biological hunger. 
Although long-term sustainment of skills would be essential for weight maintenance, the findings from the current study, together with the positive training feedback (ie, 96% enjoyed the training), suggested a promising future for weight-management programs that promote mindful eating. 
Future research should investigate the number of sessions required to sustain long-term mindful-eating skills. 
Neither present-moment awareness (PHLMS-AW) nor acting with awareness during the meal (FFMQ-AW) was found to increase significantly from pre- to posttraining. 
The small effect sizes found for the PHLMS-AW and FFMQ-AW (η  p = .01 and .02), in conjunction with the extremely low observed power (1 – β = .078 and .105), may suggest that the measures were unable to detect change, since both were originally created and validated to assess trait mindfulness, not state mindfulness. 
Furthermore, since no measure of mindful eating was available at the time that the current study was conducted, the research team changed the FFMQAW’s instruction set, which could have altered its psychometric properties; since then, the Mindful Eating Questionnaire, a self-report measure that assesses trait-like, mindful-eating behaviors, has been published. 
19 Even though the study was advertised across the university campus to obtain a diverse group of participants, the sample was small and homogenous and contained a large percentage of participants with some level of mindfulness experience. 
As a result, a selection bias may have influenced the results. 
Furthermore, the contrived meal setting was not representative of a typical real-life meal, and it is likely that removing stimuli typically present when one eats (eg, conversation) made it easier for mindful eating to occur. 
Discussion of how to apply mindful eating given the demands of daily life and a relevant mindful-eating exercise would be good additions to the current study’s protocol and make findings more generalizable. 
Although the current study had no active control group, which prevents the changes in outcome measures from being definitively attributed to the mindfulness session, qualitative results indicated that participants were able to connect what they learned in the training to their eating. 
This ability suggests that future research is warranted that examines ways of fostering mindful eating in healthy-weight participants. 
CONCLUSIONS Preliminary results suggest promising benefits for use of mindfulness training on weight-gain prevention in individuals without an eating disorder. 
More research is needed to understand the impact that mindfulness may have on longterm weight-gain prevention.
