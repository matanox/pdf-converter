Mathematics Journals Typesetting Study - meeting author needs January, 2013 Research & Academic Relations Methodology • A sample of 11,300 authors who had published in an Elsevier Mathematical journal over the last three years were invited to complete a survey to rate 5 different proposed typeset models. 
 1,316 authors completed the survey, giving a response rate of 12%. 
 Fieldwork was conducted between 4 th and 18 th December 2012. 
2 Preferences for typeset models  Respondents were asked to view 5 typeset models before choosing their favourite and least favourite. 
3 35% 19% 8% 9% 15% 14% Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 Sample 4 Sample 5 I have no preference Sample 1 receives over a third of the votes, and as this had the lowest proportion of people choosing it as favourite. 
It seems this option can be discarded. 
Only a small proportion of respondents cited sample 3 as their least favourite, compared with over 20% who rated it as their favourite – is this a potential compromise?
