Olatunji et al. / Behaviour Research and Therapy 42 (2004) 93–104 1. Introduction Fear of contamination is among the most common obsessional theme associated with obsessive– compulsive disorder (OCD), accounting for an estimated 55.0–57.7% of obsessional concerns reported by such patients (Rasmussen & Tsuang, 1986; Summerfeldt, Antony, Downie, Richter, & Swinson, unpublished manuscript). 
Given the functional relationship that exists between obsessions and compulsions, it is not surprising that recurring, intrusive thoughts of contamination are highly prevalent among compulsive washers and cleaners (Hodgson & Rachman, 1977; Leckman, Boardman, Zhang, & Grice, 1997). 
The phenomenology of washing and cleaning rituals suggests that such actions serve to protect the individual through sanitizing and disinfecting themselves and their environment. 
Protective behaviors also appear to be based on an increased perception of vulnerability to contaminating agents, such as dirt, germs, and bacteria (Rachman, 1994). 
Likewise, Riskind, Abreu, Strauss, and Holt (1997) argue that individuals with OCD experience fears of rapid, spreading infection following contact with objects that are perceived to be contaminated. 
As a consequence, compulsive washers often avoid situations and stimuli that provoke obsessional thoughts of infection (Rachman & Shafran, 1998). 
Intrusive thoughts and avoidance efforts common to OCD are often conceptualized as being functionally related to fear. 
Recent developments in theory (Woody & Teachman, 2000) and research (Woody & Tolin, 2002) have begun implicating the involvement of disgust as a possible contributor to the onset and maintenance of certain types of obsessional problems. 
The fear of contamination construct provides a unique avenue by which to examine the intersection between the emotions of fear and disgust and their relationship to OCD contamination-related concerns. 
As a basic emotion, disgust serves the adaptive value of protecting the organism from contact with and oral incorporation of noxious or contaminated stimuli (Angyal, 1941; Izard, 1977). 
In accordance with the disease avoidance model (Matchett & Davey, 1991), behavioral avoidance of disgusting material promotes sanitation while preventing direct contact and subsequent infection (Izard, 1993). 
Power and Dalgleish (1997) proposed that the emotion of disgust likely contributes to the etiology and maintenance of contamination-related obsessions and washing compulsions in OCD. 
Preliminary support for the disgust–contamination fear relationship in OCD has been generated by Mancini, Gragnani, and D’Olimpio (2001) who found statistically significant, positive correlations between full-scale disgust scores on the disgust scale (DS; Haidt, McCauley, & Rozin, 1994) and obsessive–compulsive subscales of washing (r = 0.39), checking (r = 0.38), and rumination (r = 0.31) assessed by the Padua inventory (PI; van Oppen, Hoekstra, & Emmelkamp, 1995). 
Results from a series of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disgust was not only a significant predictor of the total score on the PI, but that disgust was the single best predictor of the washing subscale over and above other measures of anxiety and depression (Mancini et al., 2001). 
Similar correlational findings have been reported in other studies examining the association between measures of disgust and OCD-related contamination fear. 
Muris et al. (2000) reported a correlation of r = 0.26 between the disgust sensitivity questionnaire (DSQ; Rozin, Fallon, & Mandell, 1984) and the Maudsley obsessive compulsive inventory (MOCI; Hodgson & Rachman, 1977). 
Sawchuk, Lohr, Tolin, Lee, and Kleinknecht (2000) found that the disgust emotion scale (DES; Walls & Kleinknecht, 1996) was positively correlated with the washing/contamination subscales on the PI (r = 0.50) and the Vancouver obsessional compulsive inventory (VOCI; Thordson, Radomsky, Rachman, Shafran, & Sawchuk, 1997) r = 0.43, while the DS yielded correlations of 0.54 and 0.49 with the PI and VOCI, respectively. 
In efforts to extend the findings derived from self-report measures, recent research has begun applying physiological methodology to the examination of the fear–disgust–contamination fear relationship (de Jong, Peters, & Vanderhallen, 2002). 
de Jong et al. (2002) found that self-reported fear of spiders during an imagery task was best predicted by disgust domains specific to contamination ideation (i.e. 
DS sympathetic magic). 
Only one study to date has examined disgust sensitivity among clinically diagnosed compulsive washers (Woody & Tolin, 2002). 
This investigation found that OCD washers showed significantly higher disgust sensitivity (as assessed by the DS) than non-anxious controls, and marginally higher disgust sensitivity than a sample of non-washing related OCD subjects. 
These between-group differences were largely accounted for by the significantly higher scores on DS subscales assessing animals and body products among the OCD washers. 
Stimuli capable of eliciting disgust represent a broad and diverse range, including animals, foods, smells, bodily products, sex, hygiene, and moral violations. 
Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley (1993) suggest that disgust elicitors generally cluster into two categories: core and animal reminder domains. 
Core disgust is based on a sense of offensiveness and the threat of contamination, consisting of stimuli such as rotting foods, waste products, and small animals that are associated with dirt and disease characteristics. 
Animal reminder disgust reflects the aversion of stimuli that serve as reminders of the animal origins of humans, such as blood, veins, tissue, and death. 
Violations of hygienic norms have been conceptualized as representing animal reminder disgust, primarily because they may be related to animalistic behavior (Haidt et al., 1994; Rozin et al., 1993). 
Hygienic concern may also represent core disgust because of its association with infectious diseases. 
Items from the hygiene subscale of the DS, for instance, imply some aversion towards and avoidance of coming into contact with objects that may be contaminated (e.g. “I never let any part of my body touch the toilet seat in a public washroom”). 
It is unclear in the current literature whether these various domains of disgust are differentially related to contamination fear. 
This is partly due to the presumption that disgust sensitivity is a unitary construct, as available studies have typically correlated measures of OCD contamination concerns with full-scale disgust questionnaire scores (Mancini et al., 2001; Sawchuk et al., 2000). 
Previous work has supported a differential association between specific disgust domains and types of phobic fears, as core disgust elicitors have been found to be more strongly related to spider fear whereas animal reminder disgust stimuli are more highly correlated with blood–injection– injury (BII) phobia (de Jong & Merckelbach, 1998). 
Data from Woody and Tolin (2002) highlight the possibility that certain categories of disgust may be more salient to OCD contamination concerns. 
It remains unclear, however, as to whether the range of disgust domains that are associated with fears of contamination represent a narrow and circumscribed set of elicitors (i.e. homogeneous) or a broad and diverse range of repugnant stimuli (i.e. heterogeneous). 
Assessing disgust as a unitary, global, and homogeneous construct fails to address the variety and heterogeneity of elicitors that can provoke a response of aversion and revulsion. 
Identifying the domains of disgust that mediate contamination fear may have implications for the treatment of obsessional problems that are thematically related to fears of contamination. 
In the present study, we predicted that general, rather than domain-specific, disgust stimuli would account for significant variance in contamination fear scores. 
Although disgust domains most closely related to fears of contamination (e.g. sympathetic magic, hygiene) were expected to account for the majority of variance in the regression equation, it was also predicted that other disgust stimuli not necessarily related to contamination fear per se (e.g. injections, death, food) would also contribute significant, albeit less, variance to the regression model. 
We further explored differences in disgust sensitivity between individuals classified as high and low in contamination fear. 
It was hypothesized that individuals high in contamination fear would yield higher scores on measures of disgust and disgust sensitivity than those low in contamination fear. 
The high contamination fear group was also expected to show greater disgust sensitivity across a variety of disgust domains (i.e. demonstrate generalized disgust sensitivity) in comparison to the low contamination fear group. 
2. Method 2.1. 
Participants Participants were selected from undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Arkansas (N = 323), and participated in exchange for research credit. 
Demographic data were unavailable for 163 participants in this sample. 
Of the remaining 160 participants, approximately 70% were female, with a mean age of 20.52 years (SD = 4.59). 2.2. 
Measures Participants were tested in groups and completed the following questionnaires. 
2.2.1. 
Disgust sensitivity questionnaires (DSQs) The DS (Haidt et al., 1994) is a 32-item scale assessing disgust sensitivity across seven domains of disgust elicitors: animals, body products, death, envelope violations (blood, injuries, etc.), food, hygiene, and sex. 
An eighth subscale, sympathetic magic (improbable contamination), is factored into the total score. 
Each subscale is comprised of four questions: the first two items are answered true/false, with reversed scoring for disgust-absent items. 
The remaining two items are answered on a three-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = ‘not disgusting at all’ to 1 = ‘extremely disgusting’. 
Alpha coefficients for the eight DS subscales range from 0.34 to 0.64 (Haidt et al., 1994). 
The DES (Walls & Kleinknecht, 1996) is a 30-item scale measuring disgust sensitivity across five domains of disgust elicitors: animals, injections and blood draws, mutilation and death, rotting foods, and smells. 
Participants are asked to rate their degree of disgust or repugnance if there were to be exposed to each item, using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = ‘no disgust or repugnance at all’ to 4 = ‘extreme disgust or repugnance’. 
Alpha coefficients for the five DES subscales range from 0.73 to 0.87 (Sawchuk, Lohr, Westendorf, Meunier, & Tolin, 2002). 
2.2.2. 
Contamination fear questionnaire The PI (Burns, Keortge, Formea, & Sternberger, 1996) contamination subscale consists of 10 items assessing contamination obsessions and washing compulsions. 
Items are scored on a fivepoint scale ranging from 0 = ‘not at all’ to 4 = ‘very much’. 
The alpha coefficient for the PI contamination subscale is 0.85 (Burns et al., 1996). 
3. Results Table 1 presents the Pearson correlation coefficients between the contamination fear measure and the disgust subscales of the DS and DES. 
Significant, positive correlations were found between all disgust subscales and the PI. Examination of the correlations indicated that the DS subscales of hygiene and sympathetic magic and DES subscales of animals and smells were most highly associated with the contamination fear measure (r range from 0.41 to 0.52). 
DES mutilation and DS sex and envelope violations appear to have a weaker relationship with contamination fear (r range from 0.20 to 0.27). 
A stepwise regression equation was then calculated for the PI on the entire sample, using the eight DS and five DES subscales as the predictor variables. 
Evidence for a domain-specific relationship between contamination fear and disgust would be noted in two cases. 
First, if variance in contamination fear scores is accounted for exclusively by disgust domains that are conceptually related to threat of contagion, such as hygiene and sympathetic magic. 
Second, if contamination fear variance is entirely predicted by disgust domains assessing a related construct (e.g. blood, injections, death). 
Alternatively, support for a generalized relationship between contamination fear and disgust would be found if a heterogeneous, broad range of disgust elicitors, such as food, sex, hygiene, and blood, successfully entered into the final regression model. 
Table 2 reports beta weights, proportional variance, and p-values of the regression equation on the entire sample using the PI as the dependent variable, predicted by the DS and DES subscales. 
The regression analysis indicated that the PI was significantly predicted by seven different disgust Table 1 Pearson correlation coefficients between the disgust domains assessed by the DES and DS and contamination fear Disgust domains PI DES rotting foods 0.33 DES smells 0.48 DES injection 0.35 DES mutilation 0.27 DES animals 0.42 DS food 0.35 DS animals 0.38 DS body products 0.38 DS sex 0.20 DS envelope violations 0.25 DS death 0.36 DS hygiene 0.52 DS sympathetic magic 0.41 DES, disgust emotions scale; DS, disgust scale; all values significant at p Ͻ 0.01.

domains, with a total R 2 = 0.442. 
DS hygiene, food, and death and DES smells, injections, mutilation, and animals all significantly entered into the regression equation. 
The disgust domain of hygiene accounted for a substantial portion of individual variance in the equation, at 27.9%. 
Smells accounted for 9.7% of the variance in contamination fear scores, with the remaining disgust domains accounting for nominal proportions, ranging from 1.9 (DS food) to 0.7% (DES animals). 
These results suggest that the nature of disgust domains that predict contamination fears as assessed by the PI is heterogeneous or general as opposed to a defined and related range of disgust elicitors. 
The results also indicate that animal reminder disgust domains (i.e. hygiene, death, mutilation) accounted for the most variance in the prediction of contamination fear, although core disgust stimuli (i.e. animals, smells) also contributed to the model. 
Contrary to initial expectations, the disgust domain of sympathetic magic, a domain conceptually related to OCD contamination fears, failed to enter into the regression equation. 
In order to examine differential responding to the various disgust domains, the sample was further divided into a high contamination fear group and a low contamination fear group. 
The high contamination fear group consisted of participants scoring at or above the OCD washer patient mean reported on the PI contamination subscale (mean = 13.87; Burns et al., 1996). 
Conversely, the low contamination fear comparison group was identified if they scored at or below the normative (i.e. non-clinical) group mean on the PI contamination subscale (mean = 6.54; Burns et al., 1996). 
A total of 52 participants were classified in the high contamination fear group (mean age = 19.60, SD = 1.54), and 154 participants comprised the low contamination fear group (mean age = 21.04, SD = 5.41). 
A two (high vs. low contamination fear group) × five (subscale) mixed-factor ANOVA on the DES yielded significant main effects for group (F(1,204) = 56.20, p Ͻ 0.0001), DES subscale (F(4,816) = 106.93, p Ͻ 0.0001), as well as a significant group × subscale interaction (F(4,816) = 2.97, p Ͻ 0.02). 
Subsequent analyses indicated that the high contamination fear group showed greater disgust sensitivity across all domains of disgust assessed by the DES (p Ͻ 0.001). 
A two (high vs. low contamination fear group) × eight (subscale) mixed-factor ANOVA on the DS also yielded significant main effects for group (F(1,204) = 76.39, p Ͻ 0.0001), DS subscale (F(7,1428) = 34.18, p Ͻ 0.0001), as well as a significant group × subscale interaction (F(7,1428) = 5.53, p Ͻ 0.0001). 
Subsequent analyses indicated that the high contamination fear group showed greater disgust sensitivity across all domains of disgust assessed by the DS (p Ͻ Table 3 Means, standard deviations, F-, and p-values on measures of disgust sensitivity for the high (N = 52), and low (N = 154) contamination fear groups Disgust domains High CF Low CF FpϽ DES rotting foods 10.75 (4.76) 7.51 (5.54) 19.31 0.0001 DES smells 15.94 (3.78) 11.19 (4.30) 50.45 0.0001 DES injection 9.58 (7.09) 4.27 (4.66) 37.98 0.0001 DES mutilation 13.58 (5.42) 10.68 (5.31) 11.48 0.001 DES animals 8.96 (4.76) 4.57 (3.93) 43.40 0.0001 DS food 2.45 (0.76) 1.71 (0.98) 25.01 0.0001 DS animals 3.05 (0.86) 2.18 (1.08) 27.48 0.0001 DS body products 3.06 (0.81) 2.19 (1.01) 31.78 0.0001 DS sex 3.42 (0.63) 3.06 (0.89) 7.24 0.008 DS envelope violations 2.87 (0.97) 2.19 (1.22) 13.32 0.0001 DS death 2.86 (1.02) 1.72 (1.24) 35.06 0.0001 DS hygiene 2.69 (0.82) 1.29 (0.79) 121.57 0.0001 DS sympathetic magic 2.95 (0.94) 1.94 (1.07) 37.44 0.0001 DS, disgust scale; DES, disgust emotions scale; CF, contamination fear.

Disgust domains that produced the largest between-group differences included DS hygiene, sympathetic magic, and death, and DES smells, animals, and injections. 
While still statistically significant, weaker group differences emerged on DS sex and envelope violations, and DES mutilation.

4. Discussion The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the various domains of disgust elicitors and contamination fear. 
This study replicates previous research demonstrating an associative relationship between disgust and contamination fear (Sawchuk et al., 2000; Ware, Jain, Burgess, & Davey, 1994). 
Significant, positive correlations were found between all disgust subscales and the PI. The DES subscale of injections and the DS subscales of body products, death, and foods were moderately correlated with the contamination fear measure, suggesting that contamination concerns may be related to a rather broad range of stimuli capable of eliciting disgust. The correlation between contamination fear and disgust subscales assessing body products, foods, and animals also suggests that disgust domains that are more capable of contagion are more strongly associated with contamination concerns. 
The DS subscales of hygiene and sympathetic magic and DES subscales of animals and smells emerged with the strongest correlations with the contamination fear measure. 
Examination of the items from the Hygiene (i.e. “I probably would not go to my favorite restaurant if I found out that the cook had a cold”), sympathetic magic (i.e. “Even if I was hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred with a used but thoroughly washed flyswatter”), animal (i.e. “A sewer rat”), and smells (i.e. “The smell of vomit”) subscales suggests that the stronger association with contamination fear may be a result of some shared underlying contagion factor (de Jong et al., 2002). 
Disgust domains yielding the weakest associations with contamination fear appear to carry less threat of contagion, as indexed by the following items: DES mutilation (i.e. “Photos of wounded soldiers”), DS sex (i.e. “You hear about a 30year-old man who seeks sexual relationships with 80-year-old women”), and DS envelope violations (i.e. “It would bother me to be in a science class, and see a human hand preserved in a jar”). 
Findings from the current study also support prior investigations demonstrating that disgust reactions in many disorders are generalized, rather than domain-specific(Sawchuk et al., 2000, 2002; Tolin, Lohr, Sawchuk, & Lee, 1997). 
Data from the stepwise regression analyses indicated that contamination fear was significantly predicted by seven different disgust domains: DS hygiene, food, and death and DES smells, injections, mutilation, and animals. 
These findings suggest that disgust domains that predict contamination fear are fairly heterogeneous or general in nature as opposed to a restricted and related range of disgust elicitors. 
Further examination of the disgust subscales that accounted for significant variance in the regression equation suggests that animal reminder disgust domains (i.e. death, hygiene, and mutilation) are generally more predictive of contamination fear. 
A number of elicitors representing core disgust (i.e. animals, smells) also successfully contributed to the final model predicting contamination fear. 
This pattern is consistent with previous research demonstrating that core and animal reminder disgust domains may be differentially related to different disorders (de Jong & Merckelbach, 1998). 
The contaminating nature of stimuli that comprise the core disgust domain cluster is likely to account for its increased relationship with contamination fear (Rozin & Fallon, 1987; Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 1999). 
Several of the items from the animal reminder cluster also represent disgust elicitors capable of producing contaminating agents, and thereby may account for their entrance into the regression equations predicting contamination fear (e.g. 
DS death: “It would bother me tremendously to touch a dead body”). 
Further research appears warranted to clarify Rozin et al.’s (1993) distinction of core disgust elicitors being characterized by their propensity of contagion, as our current findings and those reported by others (de Jong and Muris, 2002; de Jong et al., 2002) suggest that several animal reminder stimuli hold infectious capabilities as well. 
Consistent with the findings from the correlational analyses showing the strongest association between DS hygiene and contamination fear, the hygiene subscale was the single best predictor in accounting for the most variance in the regression equation. 
As argued earlier, hygienic concerns are likely to be strongly associated with contamination threat given its functional purpose of avoiding contact with objects that are perceived to be contaminated. 
The relationship between fear of contamination and hygiene disgust is consistent with the disease avoidance model (Matchett & Davey, 1991), which suggests that avoidance of such stimuli is mediated by fears of disease acquisition. 
An alternative explanation for the emergence of the hygiene disgust and contamination fear relationship may be due to the shared item content involved in the construction of each individual scale. 
For instance, avoidance of touching or using a public toilet is assessed by both the DS hygiene subscale and the PI. While this artifact of the questionnaires themselves may account for a certain degree of the observed association, DS hygiene and the PI contamination subscale only correlated at 0.52, thereby implying that the scale items were in fact assessing separate constructs. 
Additionally, several items on the PI explicitly state that contact with the stimulus would result in contamination and disease acquisition, whereas the DS hygiene subscale questions do not directly propose such a consequence. 
Furthermore, four items on the PI pertain to specific decontamination efforts and washing compulsions, while none of the DS hygiene items reflect any neutralizing behaviors. 
Finally, all 10 items on the PI reflect a personally relevant threat of contagion, whereas one of the four DS hygiene questions implies a more evaluative judgment about the cleanliness of others (i.e. “You discover that a friend of yours changes underwear only once a week”). 
Thus, while DS hygiene and the PI contamination subscales are related thematically and share some degree of item content, the two questionnaires do in fact appear to be assessing different aspects of the contamination fear construct. 
As predicted, the disgust domain of sympathetic magic was significantly correlated with contamination fear. 
Contrary to our subsequent hypothesis, however, was the finding that sympathetic magic did not enter into the regression equation. 
Sympathetic magic has been defined as the perception of being contaminated by an object, even under conditions in which no objective threat of contagion is apparent (Rozin & Fallon, 1987). 
This related theme may account for the significant, positive relationship between sympathetic magic and contamination fear. 
Sympathetic magic has also been furthered as an interpretive process akin to magical thinking (Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000), with preliminary data supporting positive associations between measures assessing magic thinking and obsessive–compulsive phenomena (Bolton, Dearsley, MadronalLuque, & Baron-Cohen, 2002; Evans, Milanak, Medeiros, & Ross, 2002). 
Rozin et al. (1999) argue that disgust and contamination fears are often manifested in two superstitious thought processes. 
The first interpretive process, referred to as ‘contagion’, suggests that perceived contact with or proximity to a disgusting object results in the permanent transfer of the object’s contaminating properties. 
The second magical thought process termed ‘similarity’, postulates that a benign object resembling a disgusting agent (e.g. chocolate shaped in the form of feces) can assume the infectious threat value of the actual repugnant stimulus. 
Thus, the broad emphasis of sympathetic magic as assessed by the DS may partially account for why this particular disgust domain did not display independent predictive properties of OCD-related contamination fears. 
Another possibility is that sympathetic magic may not be an entirely separate domain of disgust, as it is intrinsically connected to all other domains capable of eliciting this emotional response (Haidt et al., 1994). 
Examination of the items that comprise the sympathetic magic subscale (i.e. “Even if I was hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred with a used but thoroughly washed flyswatter”) suggests that they may be assessing a related construct shared between DS hygiene and PI contamination fear. 
This is sustained in the present study by the moderate, positive correlation between sympathetic magic with hygiene (r = 0.48, p Ͻ 0.0001), and further by the moderate associations found between these two disgust subscales and the PI. Rozin and Nemeroff (1990) have argued that at the core of sympathetic magic is the fear of contamination via physical contact with an entity that is capable of transmitting infectious properties. 
The authors also postulate that many hygienic concerns (i.e. body odor) serve as a primary context in which the process of sympathetic magic can happen. 
Future studies may seek to further clarify the overlapping and distinct boundaries between sympathetic magic, hygiene, and contamination fear. 
We also explored differences in disgust sensitivity between individuals classified as high and low in contamination fear. 
It was predicted that individuals scoring within the clinical range on the measure of contamination fear would yield higher disgust sensitivity scores than individuals scoring within the normal range. 
The results supported our hypothesis as the high contamination fear group showed greater disgust sensitivity across all DES and DS disgust domains. 
These findings provide additional evidence for the generalized role of disgust in contamination fear, given that the high contamination fear group reported greater disgust sensitivity across a diverse range of potential disgust elicitors as opposed to a narrow set of related disgust elicitors. 
Furthermore, the between-group difference was most pronounced on disgust elicitors related to hygiene, thereby highlighting the close relationship that exists between contamination threat and concerns about maintaining sanitation. 
As suggested by Sawchuk et al. (2000), the generalized role of disgust in contamination fear may reflect its significance as a diathesis factor in the etiology of a variety of disorders in which heightened concerns of contamination are implicated. 
Given that the presented study utilized a non-clinical population, future research should consider using a treatment-seeking clinical sample of OCD patients with contamination concerns in order to investigate the applicability and generalizability of the current findings. 
Compulsive washing and checking behaviors have been found to be best predicted by measures of disgust as opposed to those assessing anxiety and depression (Mancini et al., 2001). 
Prospective studies are also needed to determine if certain domains of disgust are differentially related to various OCD concerns. 
Experimental findings and clinical observations note that obsessional thoughts are characterized by inflated perceptions of vulnerability to threat-relevant stimuli (Rachman, 1994; Riskind et al., 1997). 
Germane to this, cognitive biases erring toward the overestimation of negative outcomes likely contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of various disorders of anxiety (McNally, 1996). 
Accordingly, the clinical manifestation of disorders in which disgust becomes a primary focus of concern may arise from an overestimation of the contaminating properties of objects in their environment, and an overestimation of the likelihood of being infected by such stimuli (de Jong & Muris, 2002). 
In the present study, approximately 44% of the variance in contamination fear scores was accounted for by a range of disgust elicitors, perhaps other emotional processes may be involved in mediating overestimation biases related to contamination. 
Future investigations may consider the separate and combined roles of other state (e.g. state anxiety, anxiety sensitivity) and trait (e.g. trait anxiety, neuroticism) factors that may also contribute to contamination fear. 
Results from the current investigation suggest that disgust is not a unitary construct. 
Different disgust domains contributed to the regression equations in the prediction of contamination fears. 
The findings from studies attempting to partial out the relationship between disgust and disorders relating to fears of contamination (i.e. 
OCD, animal phobias) may be limited by the unitary and global measure of disgust (Mancini et. al., 2001). 
First, the domains of disgust are relatively broad and heterogeneous and thus, are often classified into different sub-categories (Haidt et al., 1994; Rozin et al., 1993; Walls & Kleinknecht, 1996). 
Second, previous research has demonstrated that various categories of disgust elicitors are often related to different disorders (de Jong & Merckelbach, 1998; Sawchuk et al., 2000; Tolin et al., 1997). 
Third, the failure to identify the heterogeneous nature of disgust elicitors that elicit responses of aversion and revulsion may have treatment implications for the disorders in which contamination fears are implicated. 
Future research should consider the utility of incorporating an assessment of the broad range of disgust elicitors that may eventually be incorporated into individually tailored exposure interventions. 
Expanding the conceptualization of contamination fear as an unique intersection between the emotions of fear and disgust may not only broaden our understanding of the onset and maintenance of OCD and other phobias, but could potentially improve the specificity of treatment interventions.
